      Transport in Angola comprises:
 Railways 
* total: 2,761&nbsp;km
* narrow gauge: mainly 2,638&nbsp;km of  (Cape gauge). There is also 123&nbsp;km of  gauge (2002)

There are three separate lines which do not link up. The major railway is the Benguela railway. A fourth system once linked Gunza and Gabala.

Railways in Angola suffered a lot of damage in the civil war, particularly the Benguela railway. A $4b project is proposed to restore the lines, and even to extend the system.  It was reported in January 2008 that the repair of the Northern Line (a.k.a. Luanda Railway), 
started in October 2003 will be completed by August 2008. The work was carried out by the Chinese firm MEC-TEC.

A link to Namibia is partly under construction.

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.  Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.  In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.

The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads, though.  Many companies are coming into the country from China and surrounding nations to help improve road surfaces.  The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.  Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.
