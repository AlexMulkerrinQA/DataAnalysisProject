Demographics of Angola, Data of FAO, year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.
The demographics of Angola consist of three main ethnic groups, each speaking a Bantu language: Ovimbundu 37%, Mbundu 25%, and Bakongo 13%. Other groups include Chokwe (or Lunda), Ganguela, Nhaneca-Humbe, Ambo, Herero, and Xindunga. In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically Portuguese. Portuguese make up the largest non-African population, with at about 40,000 (though many native-born Angolans can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law). In 1975, 250,000 Cuban soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces during the civil war. 
The largest denomination  is Roman Catholicism, but there are also followers of Protestantism, increasingly Pentecostal communities, and African Initiated Churches. As of 2006, one out of 221 people were Jehovah's Witnesses. Blacks from Mali, Nigeria, and Senegal are mostly Muslims. By now few Angolans retain African Traditional Religion following different ethnic faiths.
