'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ἀνατομία}} anatomia'', from '' {{polytonic|ἀνατέμνειν}} ana: separate, apart from, and temnein'', to cut up, cut open) is a branch of [[biology]] and [[Medicine]] which studies primarily the internal structure and design of the [[body plan|structure of living things]]. It is a general term that includes [[human anatomy]], animal anatomy ([[zootomy]]) and [[plant anatomy]] (phytotomy). Anatomy is divided into various sub specialties in some of its facets anatomy is closely related to [[Embryology]], [[Histology]], [[comparative anatomy]] and [[Phylogenetics|comparative embryology]],&lt;!--

Anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy (or macroscopic anatomy) and microscopic anatomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; Gross anatomy (also called topographical anatomy, regional anatomy, or anthropotomy) is the study of anatomical structures that can be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures assisted with [[microscope]]s, which includes [[histology]] (the study of the organization of tissues),&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; and [[Cell biology|cytology]] (the study of cells).

The [[history of anatomy]] has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and structures in the body including the clinical understanding of how damage to these structures effects other functions in the body. Methods have also advanced dramatically, advancing from examination of [[animal]]s through dissection of [[cadaver]]s (dead human bodies) to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century including X-ray technology, Sonogram and MRI technology.

Anatomy should not be confused with [[anatomical pathology]] (also called morbid anatomy or [[histopathology]]), which is the study of the gross and microscopic appearances of [[disease]]d [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.

== Superficial anatomy ==
[[Superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy is important in anatomy being the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the contours or the surface of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;. Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918|dateformat = dmy| accessdate = 19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With knowledge of superficial anatomy, [[physician]]s or [[veterinary surgeon]]s gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.

== Human anatomy ==

Human anatomy, including gross [[human anatomy]] and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the adult [[human]] body.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;

Generally, students of certain [[Biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, [[Physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy]], [[nurse]]s, and [[Medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]]; and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy with practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of cadavers (dead human bodies).

[[Human anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically;&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, [[Gray's Anatomy]], has recently been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format,&lt;!--

ISBN 0-443-07168-3|dateformat = dmy | accessdate = 19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by all [[Physician|medical doctors]], especially [[surgery|surgeons]], and doctors working in some diagnostic specialities, such as [[histopathology]] and [[radiology]].

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

== Other branches ==
*[[Comparative anatomy]] relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;
*Anthropological anatomy or physical anthropology relates to the comparison of the anatomy of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s of humans.
*Artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons.
