The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', commonly referred to as the '''Articles of Confederation''', was the first [[constitution]] of the thirteen [[United States|United States of America]]. The [[Second Continental Congress]] appointed a committee to draft the 'Articles' in June 1776 and proposed the draft to the States for ratification in November 1777. The ratification process was completed in March 1781, legally federating the sovereign and independent states, allied under the [[Articles of Association]], into a new [[federation]] styled the &quot;United States of America&quot;. Under the Articles the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the central government. 

On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft declaration of independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of thirteen to prepare a draft of a constitution for a confederate type of union. The last draft of the Articles was written in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the States on November 15, 1777 in [[York, Pennsylvania]] after a year of debate. In practice the final draft of the Articles served as the ''[[de facto]]'' system of government used by the Congress (&quot;the United States in Congress assembled&quot;) until it became ''[[de jure]]'' by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. The ''Articles'' set the rules for operations of the &quot;United States&quot; confederation. The confederation was capable of making war, negotiating diplomatic agreements, and resolving issues regarding the western territories. An important element of the Articles was that Article XIII stipulated that &quot;their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state&quot; and &quot;[[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]]&quot;.

The Articles were created by the chosen representatives of the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a perceived need to have &quot;a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States.&quot; Although serving a crucial role in the victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], a group of reformers,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Its [the Philadelphia Convention's] official function was to propose revisions to the Articles. But the delegates, meeting in secret, quickly decided to draft a totally new document. Of the 55 delegates, only 8 had signed the Declaration of Independence. Most of the leading radicals, including Sam Adams, Henry, Paine, Lee, and Jefferson, were absent. In contrast, 21 delegates belonged to the militarist{{Fact|date=April 2009}} [[Society of the Cincinnati]]. Overall, the convention was dominated by the array of nationalist interests that the prior war had brought together: land speculators, ex-army officers, public creditors, and privileged merchants.&quot; [http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1400 Did the Constitution Betray the Revolution?], Jeffrey Rogers Hummel, William Marina&lt;/ref&gt;  known as &quot;[[Federalism in the United States|federalists]]&quot;, felt that the Articles lacked the necessary provisions for a sufficiently effective government. Fundamentally, a [[federation]] was sought to replace the [[confederation]]. The key criticism by those who favored a more powerful central [[Sovereign state|state]] (i.e. the federalists){{Fact|date=April 2009}} was that the government (i.e. the [[Congress of the Confederation]]) lacked taxing authority; it had to request funds from the states. Also various federalist factions wanted{{Fact|date=April 2009}} a government that could impose uniform tariffs, give land grants, and assume responsibility for unpaid state war debts (&quot;assumption&quot;.) Those opposed to the Constitution, known as &quot;anti-federalists,&quot; considered these limits on government power to be necessary and good.{{Dubious|Federalists|date=April 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The American Revolution, like all great social upheavals, was brought off by a disparate coalition of competing view-points and conflicting interests. At one end of the Revolutionary coalition stood the American radicals - men such as Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, Richard Henry Lee and Thomas Jefferson. Although by no means in agreement on everything, the radicals objected to excessive government power in general and not simply to British rule in particular.
...
At the other end of the Revolutionary coalition were the American nationalists - men such as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Robert Morris, Alexander 
Hamilton and James Madison. Representing a powerful array of mercantile, creditor and landed interests, the nationalists went along with independence but 
opposed the Revolution's libertarian thrust. They sought a strong and effective American central government, which would reproduce the hierarchical features of the eighteenth-century British State, only without the British.&quot; - Jeffrey Rogers Hummel, [http://www.la-articles.org.uk/FL-5-4-3.pdf The Constitution as Counter-Revolution: A Tribute to the Anti-Federalists]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism of the Articles was that they did not strike the right balance between large and small states in the legislative decision making process. {{Dubious|Federalists|date=April 2009}} Due to its ''one-state, one-vote'' plank, the larger states were expected to contribute more but had only one vote.

The Articles were replaced by the US Constitution on June 21, 1788.

==Background==
The political push for the colonies to increase cooperation began in the [[French and Indian Wars]] in the mid 1750s. The [[American Revolution]] in response to lack of elected representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British government]] and a rejection of the resulting law and regulation, followed by the beginning of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775 and [[Proclamation of Rebellion|a proclamation]] by the [[British Crown|monarchy]] that Congress were traitors in rebellion, induced the various states to cooperate in seceding from the [[British Empire]]. Starting 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] acted as the [[provisional government|provisional national government]] that ran the war. Congress presented the Articles for enactment by the states in 1777, while prosecuting the American Revolutionary War.

==Ratification==
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles in 1777:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states. Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties...''&lt;ref name=ratificationletter&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00941)) Monday, November 17, 1777], Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lawhome.html A Century of Lawmaking, 1774-1873]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all of the thirteen colonies. The first state to ratify was [[Virginia]] on December 16, 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |title=Articles of Confederation, 1777-1781
   |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]
   |accessdate=2008-01-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West. [[Maryland]] was the last holdout; it refused to go along until [[Virginia]] and New York agreed to cede their claims in the [[Ohio River]] valley. A little over three years passed before Maryland's ratification on March 1, 1781.

==Article summaries==
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents are very different. The original five-paged Articles contained thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section. The following list contains short summaries of each of the thirteen articles.
#Establishes the name of the confederation as &quot;The United States of America.&quot;
#Asserts the equality of the separate states with the confederation government, i.e. &quot;Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.&quot;
#Establishes the United States as a new nation, a sovereign union of sovereign states, united &quot;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&quot; while declaring that the union is &quot;perpetual,&quot; and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by ''all'' the state legislatures.
#Establishes [[freedom of movement]]&amp;ndash;anyone can pass freely between states, excluding &quot;[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.&quot; All people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
#Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (United States in Congress Assembled) to each state, which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress were appointed by state legislatures; individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years.
#Only the central government is allowed to conduct [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]] and to [[declaration of war|declare war]]. No states may have navies or standing armies, or engage in war, without permission of Congress (although the state [[militia]]s are encouraged).
#When an army is raised for common defense, colonels and military ranks below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
#Expenditures by the United States will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
#Defines the powers of the central government: to declare war, to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.
#Defines a [[Committee of the States]] to be a government when Congress is not in session.
#Requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy; pre-approves [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Canada]], if it applies for membership.
#Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the Articles.
#Declares that the Articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by all the state legislatures.

Still at war with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the Framers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government, and those seeking a loosely-structured one. Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the federal government, with a [[unicameral]] legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism to force the states to comply with requests for troops or revenue. At times, this left the military in a precarious position, as [[George Washington]] wrote in a 1781 letter to the governor of [[Massachusetts]], [[John Hancock]].

==The end of the war==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature. Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Writing to [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] in September 1783, George Washington complained:

:''Congress have come to no determination &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; respecting the Peace Establishment nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss &lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt; National points.''&lt;ref name=washingtonclinton&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field(DOCID+@lit(gw270170)) Letter George Washington to George Clinton], September 11, 1783. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gwhtml/gwhome.html The George Washington Papers, 1741-1799]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
===Military===
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the [[Continental Army]], and allowed the 13 states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:

{{quote|George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to actually supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick p. 469. Phelps pp. 165-166. Phelps wrote:
:&quot;It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life.  However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor.  No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783-1784. General Henry Knox, who would become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles of the inability of the government to fund the military.  The army had long been supportive of a strong union.&lt;ref&gt;Puls pp. 174-176&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox wrote:

{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies.  Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, “A hoop to the barrel” or “Cement to the Union.”&lt;ref&gt;Puls p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, “As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.”&lt;ref&gt;Puls p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the war was won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against Native American attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington|Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced the Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Even after peace was achieved, the weakness of the government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1786 Thomas Jefferson, concerned over the failure to fund a naval expedition against the Barbary pirates, wrote to James Monroe, &quot;It will be said there is no money in the treasury.  There never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth.  The states must see the rod.” &lt;ref&gt;Ellis 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation and commerce===
{{Expand|section=yes}}
Under the articles, Congress could make decisions, but had no power to enforce them. There was a requirement for unanimous approval before any modifications could be made to the Articles. Because the majority of lawmaking rested with the states, the central government was also kept limited.

Congress was denied the power of taxation: it could only request money from the states. The states did not generally comply with the requests in full, leaving the Confederation Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of funds. As more money was printed, continental dollars depreciated. Washington in 1779 wrote to John Jay, serving as President of the Continental Congress, &quot;that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the states. In an appeal to the states to comply Jay wrote that the taxes were &quot;the price of liberty, the peace and the safety of yourselves and posterity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued that Americans should avoid having it said &quot;that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent&quot; or that &quot;her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; The states did not respond with the money requested.

Congress was also denied the power to regulate commerce, and as a result, the states maintained control over their own trade policy as well. The states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war, and how to pay the debts became a major issue after the war. Some states paid off their debts; however, the centralizers favored federal assumption of states' debts.

===Accomplishments===
Nevertheless, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] did take two actions with lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later American expansion. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cessions|western land claims]] and cleared the way for the entry of new states.

==Signatures==
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. The copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and a cover letter had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.

But, the ''Articles'' at that time were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the ''Articles'' on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the ''Articles'' on July 21, 1778.

The other states had to wait until they ratified the ''Articles'' and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the ''Articles'' until every state had ceded its western land claims.

[[Image:Act of Maryland to ratify Articles.jpg|thumb|253px|left|The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 2, 1781]]
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]].&lt;ref name=lawsofmaryland&gt;[http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html Friday, February 2, 1781], Laws of Maryland, 1781.

The Senate then adjourned &quot;to the first Monday in August next.&quot; The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The formal signing of the ''Articles'' by the Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles entered into force and the United States came into being as a united, sovereign and national state.

Congress had debated the ''Articles'' for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The ''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union'' were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.

The signers and the states they represented were:
*[[New Hampshire]]: [[Josiah Bartlett]] and [[John Wentworth Jr.]]
*[[Massachusetts|Massachusetts Bay]]: [[John Hancock]], [[Samuel Adams]], [[Elbridge Gerry]], [[Francis Dana]], [[James Lovell (delegate)|James Lovell]], and [[Samuel Holten]]
*[[Rhode Island|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]: [[William Ellery]], [[Henry Marchant]], and [[John Collins (delegate)|John Collins]]
*[[Connecticut]]: [[Roger Sherman]], [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]], [[Oliver Wolcott]], [[Titus Hosmer]], and [[Andrew Adams (congressman)|Andrew Adams]]
*[[New York State|New York]]: [[James Duane]], [[Francis Lewis]], [[William Duer (delegate)|William Duer]], and [[Gouverneur Morris]]
*[[New Jersey]]: [[John Witherspoon]] and [[Nathaniel Scudder]]
*[[Pennsylvania]]: [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]], [[Daniel Roberdeau]], [[Jonathan Bayard Smith]], [[William Clingan]], and [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]]
*[[Delaware]]: [[Thomas McKean]], [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], and [[Nicholas Van Dyke (governor)|Nicholas Van Dyke]]
*[[Maryland]]: [[John Hanson]] and [[Daniel Carroll]]
*[[Virginia]]: [[Richard Henry Lee]], [[John Banister (lawyer)|John Banister]], [[Thomas Adams (politician)|Thomas Adams]], [[John Harvie]], and [[Francis Lightfoot Lee]]
*[[North Carolina]]: [[John Penn (delegate)|John Penn]], [[Cornelius Harnett]], and [[John Williams (delegate)|John Williams]]
*[[South Carolina]]: [[Henry Laurens]], [[William Henry Drayton]], [[John Mathews]], [[Richard Hutson]], and [[Thomas Heyward Jr.]]
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]: [[John Walton (1738-1783)|John Walton]], [[Edward Telfair]], and [[Edward Langworthy]]

Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the [[Articles of Association]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the [[United States Constitution]].

Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) was the only person besides Sherman to sign three of the great state papers of the United States: the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the [[United States Constitution]].

John Dickinson (Delaware) and Daniel Carroll (Maryland), along with Sherman and Morris, were the only four people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the [[United States Constitution]].

==Presidents of the Congress==
The following list is of those who led the [[Congress of the Confederation]] under the ''Articles of Confederation'' as the [[President of the United States in Congress Assembled|Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled]]. Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Cabinet (the Committee of the States) when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, a ''chief'' [[executive (government)|executive]] in the way the successor [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, but all of the functions he executed were under the auspices and in service of the Congress.

*[[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] (March 1, 1781&amp;ndash; July 9, 1781)
*[[Thomas McKean]] (July 10, 1781&amp;ndash;November 4, 1781)
*[[John Hanson]] (November 5, 1781&amp;ndash; November 3, 1782)
*[[Elias Boudinot]] (November 4, 1782&amp;ndash; November 2, 1783)
*[[Thomas Mifflin]] (November 3, 1783&amp;ndash; October 31, 1784)
*[[Richard Henry Lee]] (November 30, 1784&amp;ndash; November 6, 1785)
*[[John Hancock]] (November 23, 1785&amp;ndash; May 29, 1786)
*[[Nathaniel Gorham]] (June 6, 1786&amp;ndash; November 5, 1786)

==Revision and replacement==
In May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.

On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following [[James Madison|James Madison's]] recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce these interstate conflicts. At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May, 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a &quot;Grand Convention.&quot; Although the states' representatives to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get as close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:

{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When approached after leaving the close of the [[Federal Convention]], Benjamin Franklin was asked a question. This is the conversation as has been recorded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lady asked &quot;Well, Doctor, what have we got—a Republic or a Monarchy?&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A Republic, if you can keep it.” was the response of Benjamin Franklin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|antifederalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:

{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the &quot;consolidated government&quot; proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a &quot;splendid empire&quot; that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Ketcham, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&amp;pg=PA381&amp;lpg=PA381&amp;dq=ralph+ketcham+%22anti+federalist%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BQZCnGjA9c&amp;sig=rVp_ZBF9cEFFN8R5yJsW2xTMyf0#PPA381,M1 Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted, pg. 383]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to their own terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states ratified the new Constitution. The Congress under the Articles continued to sit until November 1788,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By that date, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures &quot;stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rakove 1988 p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new &quot;merchant state,&quot; much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that &quot;the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson p. 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor Daniel Farber argues that there was no clear consensus on the permanence of the Union or the issue of secession by the Founders. Farber wrote:
{{quote|What about the original understanding? The debates contain scattered statements about the permanence or impermanence of the Union. The occasional reference to the possible impermanency of the Constitution are hard to interpret. They might have referred to a legal right to revoke ratification. But they could equally could have referred to an extraconstitutional right of revolution, or to the possibility that a new national convention would rewrite the Constitution, or simply to the factual possibility that the national government might break down. Similarly, references to the permanency of the Union could have referred to the practical unlikelihood of withdrawal rather than to any lack of legal power. The public debates seemingly do not speak specifically to whether ratification under Article VII was revocable.&lt;ref&gt;Farber p.87&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, what if one or more states do violate the compact? One view, not only about the Articles but also the later Constitution, was that the state or states injured by such a breach could rightfully secede. This position was held by, among others, [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John C. Calhoun|John Calhoun]].

{{quote|If any state in the Union will declare that it prefers separation . . . to a continuance in union . . . I have no hesitation in saying, let us separate.| Jefferson letter to James Madison, 1816}} This view motivated discussions of secession and nullification at the [[Hartford Convention]], the [[Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]], and the [[Nullification Crisis]]. In his book Life of Webster Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge writes {{quote|It is safe to say that there was not a man in the country, from Washington and Hamilton to Clinton and Mason, who did not regard the new system as an experiment from which each and every State had a right to peaceably withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge's view on the unanimity of this view is contested by Judge Caleb William Loring in [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E7DB1731E033A25751C1A9649C94629ED7CF UNION NOT MADE BY THE WAR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A textbook used at West Point before the Civil War, [http://www.constitution.org/wr/rawle-00.htm A View of the Constitution], written by Judge William Rawle in 1829, states in chapter XXXII, &quot;The secession of a state from the Union depends on the will of the people of such state. The people alone as we have already seen, hold the power to alter their constitution. The Constitution of the United States is to a certain extent, incorporated into the constitutions or the several states by the act of the people. The state legislatures have only to perform certain organical operations in respect to it. To withdraw from the Union comes not within the general scope of their delegated authority. There must be an express provision to that effect inserted in the state constitutions. This is not, at present, the case with any of them, and it would perhaps be impolitic to confide it to them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}} A competing view, promoted by [[Daniel Webster]] and later by [[Abraham Lincoln]] , was that the Constitution (and Articles) established a [[Perpetual Union|permanent union]].&lt;ref&gt;This view, along with the view that the union was a binding contract from which no state could unilaterally remove itself, was included in [[Lincoln's First Inaugural|Lincoln's First Inaugural Address]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pressley p. 649-650. In 1848 Lincoln expressed “unequivocal support for the ‘right of revolution,’&quot; with the following comment regarding Mexico:
:Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable,-a most sacred right-a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government, may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can, may revolutionize, and make their own, of so much of the teritory [sic] as they inhabit. More than this, a majority of any portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movement. Such minority, was precisely the case, of the Tories of our own revolution. It is a quality of revolutions not to go by old lines, or old laws; but to break up both, and make new ones.&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Andrew Jackson]] during the [[Nullification Crisis]], in his “Proclamation to the People of South Carolina”, made the case for the perpetuity of the Union while also contrasting the differences between “revolution” and “secession”:&lt;ref&gt;Remini pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But each State having expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute jointly with the other States a single nation, cannot from that period possess any right to secede, because such secession does not break a league, but destroys the unity of a nation, and any injury to that unity is not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact, but it is an offense against the whole Union. To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that the United States are not a nation because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any offense. Secession, like any other revolutionary act, may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression; but to call it a constitutional right, is confounding the meaning of terms, and can only be done through gross error, or to deceive those who are willing to assert a right, but would pause before they made a revolution, or incur the penalties consequent upon a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This view, among others, was presented against declarations of secession from the Union by southern [[slave states]] as the [[American Civil War]] began.
