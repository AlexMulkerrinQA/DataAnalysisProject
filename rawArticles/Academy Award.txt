The '''Academy Awards''', popularly known as the '''Oscars''', are presented annually by the American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title = About the Academy Awards |publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize excellence of professionals in the [[film industry]], including [[Film director|directors]], [[actors]], and [[writers]]. The formal [[ceremony]] at which the [[awards]] are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media, and many other award ceremonies such as the [[Grammy Awards]] (for music), [[Golden Globe Awards]] (all forms of media), and [[Emmy Awards]] (for television) are often modeled from the Academy.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences itself was conceived by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]].

The [[1st Academy Awards]] ceremony was held Thursday, May 16, 1929, at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927 and 1928. It was hosted by actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and director [[William C. deMille]].  The [[81st Academy Awards]], honoring the best [[2008 in film|in film for 2008]], was held on Sunday, February 22, 2009, at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], with actor [[Hugh Jackman]] hosting the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2008/08.12.12.html Retrieved 2009-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner in Hollywood with an audience of fewer than 1,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;about2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index2.html|title=About the Academy Awards &lt;small&gt;(page 2)&lt;/small&gt;|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first year, the awards have been publicly broadcast, at first by radio then by TV after 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;about2&quot;/&gt; During the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 p.m. on the night of the awards. This method was ruined when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the awards have been broadcast from the [[Kodak Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

==Oscar statuette==
===Design===
[[Image:Academy Award Oscar (cropped).JPG|thumb|widthpx|The Oscar statuette featured in a display case.]]

The official name of the Oscar [[statuette]] is the ''Academy Award of Merit''. Made of [[gold]]-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a [[knight]] rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusade|crusader's]] [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscar.com/legacy/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on a scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican film director [[Emilio Fernandez|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;. Then, sculptor George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm | title=Muse Fountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent [[copper]] and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes for Golnaz Rahimi. Since 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html#photo14| title=Eladio Gonzalez sands and buffs Oscar #3453| work=The Big Picture| publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]| date=February 20, 2009| accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in [[Chicago, Illinois]] by manufacturer [[R.S. Owens &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Don |last=Babwin |title=Oscar 3453 is 'born' in Chicago factory |work=Associated Press |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jL1cVq-oMS6qeuUPUWfAQpf85fewD95V3MV80
|date=2009-01-27 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5e8JdSe3B |archivedate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In support of the American effort in [[World War II]], the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2|title= Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming ===
The root of the name ''Oscar'' is contested.  One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher= The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[TIME Magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html &quot;Oscars&quot;], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; and to Bette Davis's receipt of the award in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://firstmention.com/oscars.aspx|title= The Oscars, 1936|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that of the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, who first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette reminding her of her &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar&quot; in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2008 Draft Revision.&lt;/ref&gt;. Columnist Qiang Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot; (Levy 2003). The trophy was officially dubbed the &quot;Oscar&quot; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette|title=OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of the [[81st Academy Awards]] ceremony held in 2009, a total of 2,744 Oscars have been given for 1,798 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/index.html|title= A Brief History of the Oscar|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 297 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums (Levy 2003, pg 28).

This rule is highly controversial, since while the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.forbes.com/2005/02/28/cx_lr_0228oscarsales.html

   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The case of [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s grandson trying to sell Todd's Oscar statuette illustrates that there are many who do not agree with this idea. When Todd's grandson attempted to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector, the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, the buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury (Levy 2003, pg 29).

==Nomination==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to 2004, nomination results were announced publicly in early February.

===Voters===
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,835 as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=2008-01-30 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url = http://news. bbc. co. uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm|title = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher = BBC News|author = Jackie Finlay|date= 2006–03–03|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually.The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www. oscars. org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
Today, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html
   |title      = Rule Two: Eligibility
   |publisher  = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
   |accessdate = 2007-04-13
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 2 states that a film must be &quot;feature-length&quot;, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280x720]].

The members of the prince various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[79th Academy Awards]], 847 members (past and present) of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] have been nominated for an Oscar (in all categories).

==Ceremony==
===Telecast===
[[Image:31st Acad Awards.jpg|thumb|300px|31st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theater]], Hollywood, 1959]]
[[Image:81st Academy Awards Ceremony.JPG|thumb|300px|81st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Hollywood and Highland]], Hollywood, 2009]]

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent [[fashion]] designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)

The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher = Oscars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html Nielsen - Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources. The usual extension of this claim is that only the [[Super Bowl]], [[Olympics]] Opening Ceremonies, and [[FIFA World Cup]] Final draw higher viewership.

The Awards show was first televised on [[NBC]] in 1953. [[NBC]] continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which [[NBC]] resumed the broadcasts. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[Nielsen Ratings#&quot;Sweeps&quot;|sweeps]] period. (The ceremony was moved into early March during 2006, in deference to the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 38 wins and 167 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On March 30, 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after [[Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Since 2002, celebrities have been seen arriving at the Academy Awards in [[hybrid vehicle]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly Carter&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Ratings===
Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast in [[70th Academy Awards|1998]], the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html Business &amp; Technology | Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | Seattle Times Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=January 26, 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by ''Variety'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party | publisher = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another low-budget, independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

==Criticism==
The Academy Awards are not without criticism.  The Oscars are generally voted on by members of the entertainment industry; thus, important films that have had the most people working on them generally become nominated.  Director [[William Friedkin]], an Oscar winner and producer of the Academy Awards, spoke critically of the awards at a conference in New York in 2009.  He characterized the Academy Awards as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date2=2009-02-24 |title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars.  The first to do so was [[Dudley Nichols]] ([[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Writing]] in [[1935 in film|1935]] for ''[[The Informer (film)|The Informer]]'').  Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writer's Guild.&lt;ref name=DYK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp|title=The Oscars Did You Know?|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in [[1970 in film|1970]] for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''), at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony.  Scott explained, &quot;The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade.  I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm BBC News obituary], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html TIME archives]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp]  The third winner, [[Marlon Brando]], refused his award ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in [[1972 in film|1972]] for ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.  At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech detailing Brando's criticisms.&lt;ref name=DYK/&gt;
