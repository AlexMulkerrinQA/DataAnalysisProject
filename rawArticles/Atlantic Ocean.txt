{{Five oceans}}
The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the second-largest of the world's [[ocean]]ic divisions; with a total [[area]] of about 106.4 million square kilometres (41.1 million square miles). It covers approximately one-fifth of the [[Earth]]'s surface. The first part of its name refers to the [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], making the Atlantic the &quot;Sea of Atlas&quot;. The oldest known mention of this name is contained in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (I 202); see also: ''[[Atlas Mountains]]''. Another name historically used was the ancient term [[Ethiopic Ocean]], derived from [[Ethiopia]], whose name was sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for all of Africa and thus for the ocean. Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term &quot;ocean&quot; itself was to them synonymous with the waters beyond Western Europe that we now know as the Atlantic and which the Greeks had believed to be a gigantic river encircling the world; see [[Oceanus]].

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending 
longitudinally between the [[Americas]] to the west, and [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] to the east. A component of the all-encompassing [[World Ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]] (which is sometimes considered a sea of the Atlantic), to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south.  (Alternatively, in lieu of it connecting to the Southern Ocean, the Atlantic may be reckoned to extend southward to [[Antarctica]].)  The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and '''South Atlantic Ocean''' but for physical purposes the division is rotated slightly counter-clockwise to a line roughly from the [[Bolama Region|Bolama]] region, [[Guinea-Bissau]] to [[Rio Grande do Norte]] state, [[Brazil]] to include the [[Gulf of Guinea]] with the South Atlantic and the north coast of [[South America]] with the North Atlantic.

__TOC__

==Geography==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the western coast of Portugal.]]
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. In the north and northeast, it is separated from the Arctic Ocean by the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Jan Mayen]], [[Svalbard]], and mainland [[Europe]]. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]], and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are [[Europe]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], one of its [[marginal sea]]s, and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]]), and Africa. In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean, the border being defined by the [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]]. While some authorities show the Atlantic Ocean extending south to [[Antarctica]], others show it as bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iodeweb5.vliz.be/oceanteacher/index.php?module=contextview&amp;action=contextdownload&amp;id=gen11Srv32Nme37_366 ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'']. International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In the southwest, the [[Drake Passage]] connects it to the Pacific Ocean. A [[man-made]] link between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the [[Panama Canal]]. Beside those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Hudson Bay]], the Arctic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]], and the [[Celtic Sea]].

Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second to the Pacific Ocean in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about 106,400,000&amp;nbsp;square kilometers (41,100,000&amp;nbsp;sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000&amp;nbsp;sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometers (85,100,000&amp;nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&amp;nbsp;cu mi).

The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,339 meters (10,936 ft); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft). The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The width of the Atlantic varies from 2,848 kilometers (1,770 mi) between [[Brazil]] and [[Sierra Leone]] to over {{convert|6400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the south.

==Cultural significance==
[[Transatlantic travel]] played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas. Today, it can be referred to in a humorously diminutive way as '''the Pond''' in idioms, in reference to the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe. Some British people refer to the USA as &quot;across the pond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Example: BBC Click - Episode 04 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean bottom==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
[[Image:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Atlantic [[bathymetry]].]]
The principal feature of the [[bathymetry]] (bottom [[topography]]) of the Atlantic Ocean is a submarine mountain range called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. It extends from Iceland in the north to approximately 58° South latitude, reaching a maximum width of about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi). A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water over the ridge is less than 2,700 m (8,900 ft) in most places, and several mountain peaks rise above the water and form islands. The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the Walvis Ridge. 

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths averaging between 3,700 and 5,500 metres (12,000 and 18,000 ft). Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the [[Blake Basin|Blake]], Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat, although numerous seamounts and some [[guyot]]s exist. Several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor. The [[Puerto Rico Trench]], in the North Atlantic, is the deepest at 8,605 meters (28,232 ft). The [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]. In the [[South Atlantic]], the [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of 8,428 metres (27,651 ft). A third major [[trench]], the [[Romanche Trench]], is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about 7,454 metres (24,455 ft). The shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography. Several deep channels cut across the [[continent]]al rise.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of terrigenous, pelagic, and authigenic material. Terrigenous deposits consist of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts. Pelagic deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerinida|Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 60 to 3,300 metres (200 to 11,000 ft), they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling. Authigenic deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where [[sediment]]ation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits

==Water characteristics==
[[Image:Circulacion termohalina.jpg|Path of the [[thermohaline circulation]].  Purple paths represent deep-water currents, while blue paths represent surface currents.|thumb|]]
[[Image:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major ocean gyres]]
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the [[salinity]] of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 - 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of [[sea ice]]. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] to 29&amp;nbsp;°C (28&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 84&amp;nbsp;°F). &lt;!-- less than 2 is not −2, but assuming less than -2 intended, degree signs butt to letter with space from number --&gt; Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C (13 °F to 14 °F).

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the [[Sargasso Sea]], in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for both the [[European eel]] and the [[American eel]].

Because of the [[Coriolis effect]], water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[Image:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|right|Waves in the [[trade wind]]s in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.]]

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less tendency toward extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Drift]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks]] area) and the north-western coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
[[Image:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|[[Pangaea]] separation animation, which formed the Atlantic Ocean known today.]]
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of all five oceans. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent, [[Pangaea]], were being rifted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The [[Vikings]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Christopher Columbus]] were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the [[Americas]] (known as [[transatlantic]] trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, most famously the [[Challenger expedition]], but also including those by the German Meteor expedition, [[Columbia University]]'s Lamont Geological Observatory, and the [[United States Navy]] [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]].

*1914-1918, the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]].
*In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[fixed-wing aircraft]] (seaplane) to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands and the sea along the way, and taxied several hundred miles on the surface).
*Later in 1919, a British [[aeroplane]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]].
*In 1921, the [[United Kingdom|British]] were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an [[airship]].
*In 1922, [[Artur de Sacadura Cabral|Sacadura Cabral]] and [[Gago Coutinho]] were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
*The first transatlantic [[telephone]] call was made on January 7, 1927.

*In 1980, [[Gérard d'Aboville]] is the first man to cross the Atlantic Ocean rowing.
*In 1994, [[Guy Delage]] was the first man to swim across the Atlantic Ocean (with the help of a kick board, from the [[Cape Verde islands]] to [[Barbados]].
*In 1998, [[Benoit Lecomte]] was the first man to swim across the northern Atlantic Ocean without the help of a kick board, stopping for only one week in the [[Azores]].

==Economy==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves and the world's richest [[fishing]] resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]]. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the shelf area off [[Nova Scotia]], [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.

Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the Caribbean Sea or up the east coast of [[North America]]; hurricanes can occur from May to December but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.
--&gt;

==Terrain==

The surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], Denmark Strait, and Baltic Sea from October to June. There is a clockwise warm-water [[gyre]] in the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic. The ocean floor is dominated by the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]]. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the islands rising from it.

The Atlantic Ocean has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Norwegian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Caribbean Sea]].

Islands in the Atlantic Ocean include [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Great Britain]] (including numerous surrounding islands), [[Ireland]], [[Rockall]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Sable Island]], [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Caribbean]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Sao Tome e Principe]], [[Annobon Province]], [[St. Peter Island]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|The Islands of Trindad]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Gough Island]] (Also known as Diego Alvarez), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[Bouvet Island]].

===Natural resources===
Petroleum and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], marine mammals ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), sand and gravel aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], precious stones

===Natural hazards===
[[Image:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean.]]
[[Iceberg]]s are common in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and the [[Madeira Islands]]. Ships are subject to [[superstructure#Engineering concept|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in extreme northern Atlantic from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The southeast coast of the United States has a history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs. The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but coast guard records do not support this belief.
{{clear}}

==Current environmental issues==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whales]]. [[Drift net]] fishing is killing [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes.&lt;ref&gt; animallaw.info: Problems and Prospects for the Pelagic Driftnet  [http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus12bcenvtlafflrev473.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern [[United States]], southern Brazil, and eastern [[Argentina]]; oil pollution in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]]; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], and Mediterranean Sea.

In 2005, there was some concern that the currents warming northern Europe were slowing down, but no scientific consensus was formed based on the reported evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5033329 Atlantic Ocean's 'Heat Engine' Chills Down] by Christopher Joyce. All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 30 Nov, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

===Marine pollution===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the Ocean, and with it the many chemicals used as [[fertilizers]] in agriculture as well as waste from [[livestock]] and [[humans]]. The excess of oxygen depleting chemicals in the water leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach: Marine Pollution, Springer, Berlin  (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine debris]], also known as marine litter, is a term used to describe human-created waste that has found itself floating in a lake, sea, ocean or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.
