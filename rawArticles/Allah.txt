{{about|the Arabic word &quot;Allah&quot;|the Islamic conception of God|God in Islam}}

'''Allah''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;الله&lt;/big&gt;}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'', {{IPA-ar|ʔalˤːɑːh|IPA|Ar-allah.ogg}}) is the standard [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for '''[[God]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; While the term is best known in the [[Western world|West]] for its use by [[Muslim]]s as a reference to God, it is used by Arabic-speakers of all [[Abrahamic]] faiths, including  [[Christian]]s and [[Jew]]s, in reference to &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt; &quot;Allah.&quot; [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;&gt; Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa, ''Allah'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt;[[Columbia Encyclopedia]], ''Allah''&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used by [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Mecca]]ns as a reference to the creator-god, possibly the supreme deity in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;L. Gardet, &quot;Allah&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts associated with the term ''Allah'' (as a deity) differ among the traditions. In pre-Islamic Arabia amongst pagan Arabs, ''Allah'' was not considered the sole divinity, having associates and companions, sons and daughters - a concept which [[Islam]] thoroughly and resolutely abrogated. In Islam, the name Allah is the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name. All other divine names are believed to refer back to Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tao-Islam&quot;&gt;{{Citation

{{Arabicterm|الله|Allāh|God}}

==Etymology==
[[Image:Allahmedal.jpg|thumb|Medallion showing 'Allah' in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], Turkey.]]

The term ''Allāh'' is derived from a [[contraction]] of the Arabic definite article ''[[al-]]'' &quot;the&quot; and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[ʾilāh|ʼilāh]]}}'' &quot;deity, god&quot; to ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-lāh}}'' meaning &quot;the [sole] deity, God&quot; (''ho theos monos'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt; L. Gardet, ''Allah'', Encyclopaedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cognates]] of the name &quot;Allāh&quot; exist in other [[Semitic languages]], including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt; Columbia Encyclopaedia says: Derived from an old Semitic root referring to the Divine and used in the Canaanite ''[[El]]'', the Mesopotamian ''[[ilu]]'', and the biblical ''[[Elohim]]'' and ''[[Eloah]]'', the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other monotheists.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding [[Aramaic]] form is אֱלָהָא ''{{Unicode|ʼĔlāhā}}'' in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and ܐܰܠܳܗܳܐ ''{{Unicode|ʼAlâhâ}}'' or ''{{Unicode|ʼĀlōho}}'' in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cal&quot;&gt;[http://cal1.cn.huc.edu The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon] - Entry for ''{{Unicode|ʼlh}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

The contraction of ''al-'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[ʾilāh|ʼilāh]]}}'' in forming the term ''Allāh'' (&quot;the god&quot;, masculine form) parallels the contraction of ''al-'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[ʾilāha|ʼilāha]]}}'' in forming the term ''Allāt'' (&quot;the goddess&quot;, feminine form).&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt;

==Usage in Arabic==
===Pre-Islamic Arabia===
In pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was used by Meccans as a reference to the creator-god, possibly the supreme deity.&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an {{cite quran|13|16|style=nosup|expand=no}} ; {{cite quran|29|61-63|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|31|25|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|39|38|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Allah in Stone in Rohtas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Allah at [[Rohtas Fort]] Pakistan]]
Allah was not considered the sole divinity; however, Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain. The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;/&gt; Allah was associated with companions, whom pre-Islamic Arabs considered as subordinate deities. Meccans held that a kind of kinship existed between Allah and the [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an {{cite quran|37|158|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; Allah was thought to have had sons&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an ({{cite quran|6|100|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; and that the local deities of [[al-‘Uzzá|al-ʻUzzá]], [[Manāt]] and [[al-Lāt]] were His daughters.&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an ({{cite quran|53|19-22|style=nosup|expand=no}} ; {{cite quran|16|57|style=nosup|expand=no}} ; {{cite quran|37|149|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; The Meccans possibly associated angels with Allah.&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an ({{cite quran|53|26-27|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GodEoQ&quot;/&gt; Allah was invoked in times of distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodEoQ&quot;&gt; Gerhard Böwering, ''God and his Attributes'', Encyclopedia of the Qur'an&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an {{cite quran|6|109|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|10|22|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|16|38|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|29|65|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abd Allah ibn Abd al Muttalib|Muhammad's father's]] name was {{Unicode|‘Abdallāh}} meaning the “servant of Allāh.” or &quot;the slave of Allāh&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GodEoQ&quot;/&gt;

===Muslims===

{{see also|Names of God in the Qur'an}}

According to Islamic belief, Allah is the proper name of God,&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;&gt; Böwering, Gerhard, ''God and His Attributes'', Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and humble submission to His Will, Divine Ordinances and Commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; &quot;He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt; Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, ''Allah'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt; &quot;He is unique (''wahid'') and inherently one (''ahad''), all-merciful and omnipotent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Qur'an declares &quot;the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Dcp7323-Edirne-Eski Camii Allah.jpg|thumb|150px|Allah script outside [[Eski Cami]] (The Old Mosque) in [[Edirne]], [[Turkey]].]]
In Islamic tradition, there are [[99 Names of God]] (''al-asma al-husna'' lit. meaning: &quot;The best names&quot;) each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentley |first=David |coauthors= |title=The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book |publisher=William Carey Library |year=1999 |month=September |isbn=0-87808-299-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tao-Islam&quot;/&gt; Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are &quot;the Merciful&quot; (''[[Rahman (name)|al-rahman]]'') and &quot;the Compassionate&quot; (''al-rahim'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;/&gt;

Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase &quot;[[Insha'Allah|insha' Allah]]&quot; (meaning &quot;God willing&quot;) after references to future events.&lt;ref&gt;Gary S. Gregg, ''The Middle East: A Cultural Psychology'', Oxford University Press, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of &quot;[[bismillah]]&quot;(meaning &quot;In the name of God&quot;).&lt;ref&gt; Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, ''Islamic Society in Practice'', University Press of Florida, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including &quot;[[Subhan'allah|Subhan-Allah]]&quot; (Holiness be to God), &quot;[[Alhamdulillah]]&quot; (Praise be to God), &quot;[[Shahada|La-il-la-ha-illa-Allah]]&quot; (There is no deity but God) and &quot;[[Takbir|Allāhu Akbar]]&quot; (God is great) as a devotional exercise of remembering God ([[zikr]]).&lt;ref&gt;M. Mukarram Ahmed, Muzaffar Husain Syed, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'',Anmol Publications PVT. LTD, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Sufi]] practice known as ''zikr Allah'' (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name ''Allah'' or other divine names while controlling his or her breath.&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Ernst, Bruce B. Lawrence,'' Sufi Martyrs of Love: The Chishti Order in South Asia and Beyond'', Macmillan, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Arabic-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word &quot;Allah&quot; to mean &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for 'God' than 'Allah'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt; (Even the Arabic-descended [[Maltese language]] of [[Malta]], whose population is almost entirely [[Roman Catholic]], uses ''Alla'' for 'God'.) Arab Christians for example use terms ''Allāh al-ʼab'' (الله الأب) meaning [[God the Father|God the father]], ''Allāh al-ibn'' (الله الابن) mean [[Son of God|God the son]], and ''{{Unicode|Allāh al-rūḥ al-quds}}'' (الله الروح القدس) meaning [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]] (See [[God in Christianity]] for the Christian concept of God).

[[Arab Christian]]s have used two forms of invocations that were [[affix]]ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ''basm-allah'', and also created their own Trinitized ''basm-allah'' as early as the eight century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; The Muslim ''basm-allah'' reads: &quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.&quot; The Trinitized ''basm-allah'' reads: &quot;In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.&quot; The [[Syria]]c, [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] invocations do not have the words &quot;One God&quot; at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas E. Burman, ''Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs'', [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], 1994, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marshall Hodgson]], it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.&lt;ref&gt; Marshall G. S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'', [[University of Chicago Press]], p.156 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usage==
===English and other European languages===
{{Islam}}
The history of the word &quot;Allāh&quot; in [[English language|English]] was probably influenced by the study of [[comparative religion]] in 19th century; for example, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muhammad (1934), [[Tor Andræ]] always used the term Allah, though he allows that this 'conception of God' seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies. By this time Christians were also becoming accustomed to retaining the Hebrew term &quot;[[Yahweh]]&quot; untranslated (it was previously translated as 'the Lord').&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt45&quot;&gt;William Montgomery Watt, ''Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue'', [[Routledge]], 1983, p.45 &lt;/ref&gt;

Languages which may not commonly use the term ''Allah'' to denote a deity may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long [[Al-Andalus|Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula]], the word ojalá in the [[Spanish language]] and oxalá in the [[Portuguese language]] exist today, borrowed from [[Arabic]] (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This word literally means &quot;God willing&quot; (in the sense of &quot;I hope so&quot;).&lt;ref&gt; Islam in Luce López Baralt, ''Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present'', Brill, 1992, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslims leave the name &quot;Allāh&quot; untranslated in English.&lt;ref&gt; F. E. Peters, ''The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition'', [[Princeton University Press]], p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this comes from a zeal for the Arabic text of the Qur'an and sometimes with a more or less conscious implication that the Jewish and Christian concept of God is not completely true in its details.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson&quot;&gt; Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization, University of Chicago Press, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the usage of the term Allah by English speaking non-Muslims in reference to the God in Islam, Marshall G. S. Hodgson says, can imply that Muslims are worshiping a mythical god named 'Allah' rather than God, the creator. This usage is therefore appropriate, Hodgson says, only for those who are prepared to accept its theological implications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--
One of the earliest surviving translations of the word ''Allāh'' into a foreign language is in a Greek translation of the Shahada, from 86-96 AH (705-715 AD), which translates it as ''ho theos monos'',&lt;ref&gt;A Bilingual Papyrus Of A Protocol - Egyptian National Library Inv. No. 61, 86-96 AH [http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Papyri/enlp1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative religion===
Some scholars{{Who|date=December 2008}} have suggested that Muhammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt; According to Böwering, in contrast with Pre-Islamic Arabian [[polytheism]], God in Islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between God and jinn.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt; Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.&lt;ref&gt;Allah, ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Francis Edwards Peters]], &quot;The [[Qur'an]] insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that [[Muhammad]] and his followers worship the same God as the Jews ({{cite quran|29|46|style=nosup|expand=no}}). The Quran's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with [[Abraham]]&quot;. Peters states that the Qur'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows [[Israel]]ites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters1&quot;&gt; F.E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Typography==
[[Image:Allah.svg|thumb|right|200px|An example of ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'' written in simple Arabic calligraphy.]]

The word ''Allāh'' is always written without an [[aleph|alif]] to spell the ''ā'' vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell ''ā''. However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic ''alif'' is added on top of the ''[[shadda]]h'' to indicate the pronunciation.

One exception may be in the pre-Islamic [[History of the Arabic alphabet#Pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions|Zabad inscription]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Zebed Inscription: A Pre-Islamic Trilingual Inscription In Greek, Syriac &amp; Arabic From 512 CE

 | date=March 17, 2005
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone-standing ''h'' with a lengthened start, or may be a non-standard conjoined ''l-h'':-
* {{lang|ar| الاه }}: This reading would be ''Allāh'' spelled phonetically with ''alif'' for the ''ā''.
* {{lang|ar| الاله }}: This reading would be ''Al-ʼilāh'' = &quot;the god&quot; (an older form, without contraction), by older spelling practice without ''alif'' for ''ā''.

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] has a codepoint reserved for ''Allāh'', {{lang|ar|ﷲ}} = U+FDF2.
This character according to the official Unicode specification is a ligature of ''alif-lām-lām-shadda-(superscript alif)-hā'' ({{script|Arab|اللّٰه}} U+0627 U+0644 U+0644 U+0651 U+0670 U+0647).
There is, however some confusion arising from the fact that Arabic typography usually features a ''{{lang|ar-Latn|llāh}}'' glyph without the preceding alif, which only occurs phrase-initially (or with {{transl|ar|DIN|''[[hamza]]tu l-waṣl''}} {{script|Arab|آ}} in Qur'anic orthography). Consequently, the majority of [[Arabic Unicode]] fonts do not conform with the specification and have a glyph without the alif at this position (e.g. those provided by [http://www.linotype.com/2517/arabicfonts.html Linotype], the great majority of those licensed to or developed by [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/FontPortal.aspx?PID=8 Microsoft], those of [http://www.arabeyes.org Arabeyes.org], [[SIL]]'s [http://scripts.sil.org/ArabicFonts Lateef] and the fonts of [http://www.crulp.org CRULP] developed in Pakistan),
while others have the prescribed form with alif (e.g. [http://scripts.sil.org/ArabicFonts SIL's Scheherazade], [http://www.tdc.org/news/2006Results/AdobeArabic.html Adobe Arabic] distributed with the Middle-Eastern version
of the [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html Adobe Reader 7], [[Arial Unicode MS]], and [http://sakkal.com/type/typesetting.html Arabic Typesetting], distributed with [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx VOLT] and with [http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/language/proofingtools.mspx Microsoft Office Proofing Tools 2003]).

The calligraphic variant of the word used as the [[Coat of arms of Iran]] is encoded in Unicode, in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] range, at codepoint U+262B ({{unicode|☫}}).
