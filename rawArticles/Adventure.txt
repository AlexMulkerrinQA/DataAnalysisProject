An '''adventure''' is an activity that comprises [[risk]]y, dangerous or uncertain experiences. The term is more popularly used in reference to physical activities that have some potential for danger, such as [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], and [[extreme sports]]. The term is broad enough to refer to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with risk, such as a business venture or a major life undertaking. An [[adventurer]] is a person who bases their lifestyle or their fortunes on adventurous acts.

Adventurous experiences create psychological and physiological [[arousal]], which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]), and which can become a detriment as per the [[Yerkes-Dodson law]].  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.

Adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement, such as multi-sport [[adventure racing]] or a traveler's [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. However, an adventurous activity can lead to gains in knowledge, such as in the case of the numerous pioneers who have explored and charted the Earth and, in recent times, traveled into space and to the [[Moon]]. As a more modern example, [[adventure education]] makes use of challenging experiences for learning.

Moreover, adventure can be describing an unusual experience or participating in exciting undertakings. An adventure action can be involving risky undertaking or an action without concerning outcome. In addition, taking an adventure can be illustrating taking the chance or to adventure an opinion.
