'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' (26 July 1894&amp;nbsp;– 22 November 1963) was an English writer and one of the most prominent members of the famous [[Huxley family]]. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death in 1963. Best known for his [[novel]]s including ''[[Brave New World]]'' and wide-ranging output of [[essay]]s, he also published [[short stories]], [[poetry]], [[travel writing]], and [[film]] stories and scripts. 

Aldous Huxley was a [[humanism|humanist]] and [[pacifist]], and he was latterly interested in spiritual subjects such as [[parapsychology]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[mysticism]]. He is also well known for advocating and taking [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]].

By the end of his life Huxley was considered, in some academic circles, a leader of modern thought and an intellectual of the highest rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{See also|Huxley family}}

=== Early years ===
[[File:Huxley-Arnold family tree.png|thumb|right|Family tree]]
Aldous Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], England in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and school-master [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] and first wife, Julia Arnold who founded Prior's Field School. Julia was the niece of [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[zoologist]], [[agnostic]] and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding [[biology|biologists]]. Huxley had another brother Noel Trevenen (1891-1914) who committed suicide after a period of [[clinical depression]].

Huxley began his learning in his father's well-equipped [[botanical]] [[laboratory]], then continued in a school named Hillside. His teacher was his mother who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he was educated at [[Eton College]]. Huxley's mother died in 1908, when he was fourteen. In 1911, he suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldous's near-[[blindness]] disqualified him from service in [[World War I]]. Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study [[English literature]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He graduated in 1916 with first class honours.
:&quot;I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career...His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a memorial volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p22&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his education at [[Balliol]], Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. He taught French for a year at Eton, where Eric Blair (later known by the pen name [[George Orwell]]) and [[Stephen Runciman]] were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn’t keep discipline. Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;
{{cite book|last = Crick|first = Bernard|title= George Orwell: A Life|year=1992|publisher= Penguin Books|location = London|ISBN= 014014563X}} &lt;/ref&gt; For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the [[Air Ministry]].

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically-advanced [[Brunner Mond|Brunner and Mond]] chemical plant in [[Billingham]], [[Teesside]], and the most recent introduction to his famous [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) states that this experience of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was one source for the novel.

Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of seventeen and began writing seriously in his early twenties. His earlier work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'' Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and Pavlovian conditioning. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F.M. Alexander|F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

=== Middle years ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Left to right: [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]].]]
During [[World War I]], Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]], home of Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. Here he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures including [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Clive Bell]]. Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. In 1919 he married Maria Nys (10 September 1898 - 12 February 1955), a Belgian woman he met at Garsington. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 - 10 February 2005), who had a career as an [[epidemiologist]]. The family lived in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend D. H. Lawrence. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, he edited his letters (1933).

In 1937, Huxley moved to [[Hollywood, California]] with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of &quot;liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love&quot;, they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it. 

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]], [[meditation]], and [[vegetarianism]] through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938 Huxley befriended [[J. Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of [[Swami]] [[Swami Prabhavananda|Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer Dies the Swan]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley that year's [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction. Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period Huxley earned some Hollywood income as a writer. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and [[screenwriter]], put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (1943 film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (The film was eventually filmed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and stars.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1944 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). 

However, his experience in Hollywood was not a success. When he wrote a synopsis of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Walt Disney]] rejected it on the grounds that &quot;he could only understand every third word&quot;. Huxley's leisurely development of ideas, it seemed, was not suitable for the movie moguls, who demanded fast, dynamic dialogue above all else.

With respect to details about the true quality of Huxley’s eyesight at specific points in his life, there are differing accounts. Around 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates Method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Corbett]], who was able to teach him in the method. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without [[glasses]] and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'' which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK).  It was from this period, with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book, that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of Huxley’s eyesight.

It was, and to a noticeable extent, still is widely held that, for most of his life, since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, that his eyesight was exceedingly poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford).  For instance, some ten years after publication of ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;From Bennet Cerf’s column in ''The Saturday Review'', 12 April 1952, quoted in

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera Huxley]], would later emphasize in her biographical account, ''[[This Timeless Moment]]'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.&quot; Here, she portrays the accomplishment as both metaphorical and considerably physiological in nature, attributing that which she cites [[J. Krishnamurti]] as naming the spirit of &quot;freedom from the known&quot;, which she suggests that Huxley applied, nonexhaustively, in writing ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'' and utilizing the [[Bates Method]].  After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempers her more abstract claims with the admission:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision.  For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Huxley|first = Laura|title=This Timeless Moment|year=1968|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |location = New York}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laura Huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley’s eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating Orwell on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&quot;. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Huxley |first = Aldous |editor = Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location = London |ISBN= 070111312X}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Post-war ===
After [[World War II]] Huxley applied for United States citizenship, but his application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the U.S., so he withdrew it. Nevertheless, he remained in the country, and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Government|Macmillan government]]. During the 1950s Huxley's interest in the field of [[psychical research]] grew keener, and his later works are strongly influenced by both [[mysticism]] and his experiences with [[psychedelic drugs]]. 

In October 1930, the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] dined with Huxley in Berlin, and to this day rumours persist that Crowley introduced Huxley to [[peyote]] on that occasion. He was introduced to [[mescaline]] (considered to be the key active ingredient of peyote) by the psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas.  Friday, August 22, 2008  &quot;Humphry Osmond, 86, Who Sought Medicinal Value in Psychedelic Drugs, Dies&quot;.  New York: ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December 1955, Huxley took his first dose of [[LSD]]. Indeed, Huxley was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use &quot;in a search for enlightenment&quot;, famously taking 100 micrograms of [[LSD]] as he lay dying. His [[psychedelic]] [[Recreational drug use|drug]] experiences are described in the essays ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (the title deriving from some lines in the book ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[William Blake]]), and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]''. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early [[hippies]]. While living in Los Angeles, Huxley was a friend of [[Ray Bradbury]]. According to Sam Weller's biography of Bradbury, the latter was dissatisfied with Huxley, especially after Huxley encouraged Bradbury to take psychedelic drugs.

In 1955, Huxley's wife, Maria, died of [[breast cancer]]. In 1956 he married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911-2007), also an author. She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a [[biography]] of Huxley. In 1960 Huxley himself was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer|cancer]], and in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969 ASIN B0006CDQZ8 &lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; at the [[Esalen]] institute, which were fundamental to the forming of the [[Human Potential Movement]]. On his deathbed, unable to speak, Huxley made a written request to his wife for &quot;[[LSD]], 100 µg, intramuscular&quot;. According to her account of his death, in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:45 am and another a couple of hours later. He died at 5:21 pm on 22 November 1963, aged 69. Media coverage of his death was overshadowed by the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], on the same day, as was the death of the Irish author [[C. S. Lewis]]. This coincidence was the inspiration for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]'' {{Harvard citation|Kreeft|1982}}. Huxley's ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in Compton, a village near [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], England.

Huxley's only child, Matthew, was also an author, as well as an educator, [[anthropology|anthropologist]], and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]]. His work ranged from promoting universal health care to establishing standards of care for nursing home patients and the mentally ill to investigating the question of what is a socially sanctionable drug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84 (washingtonpost.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthew's first marriage, in April 1950, was to documentary filmmaker [[Ellen Hovde]], and ended in divorce in 1961. His second wife, author and ''[[Washington Post]]'' food columnist Judith Wallet Bordage, whom he married on 22 March 1963, died in 1983. He was survived by his third wife, Franziska Reed Huxley, and two children from his first marriage, Trevenen Huxley (b. 20 October 1951) and Tessa Huxley (b. October 1953).

=== Association with Vedanta ===
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta]] Society of Southern California, founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices. 

From 1941 through 1960 Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the Society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. 

After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

== Literary themes ==
''Crome Yellow'' (1921) attacks [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] social principles which led to World War I and its terrible aftermath. Together with Huxley's second novel, ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), the book expresses much of the mood of disenchantment of the early 1920s. It was intended to reflect, as Huxley stated in a letter to his father, &quot;the life and opinions of an age which has seen the violent disruption of almost all the standards, conventions and values current in the present epoch.&quot;

Huxley's reputation for iconoclasm and emancipation grew. He was condemned for his explicit discussion of sex and free thought in his fiction. ''Antic Hay'', for example, was burned in Cairo and in the years that followed many of Huxley's books were received with disapproval or banned at one time or another. The exclusion of ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' and ''Island'' from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Best 100 novels list in 2006 created an uproar.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Huxley, however, said that a novel should be full of interesting opinions and arresting ideas, describing his aim as a novelist as being 'to arrive, technically, at a perfect fusion of the novel and the essay'; and with ''Point Counter Point'' (1928), Huxley wrote his first true 'novel of ideas', the type of thought-provoking fiction with which he is now associated.

One of his main ideas was pessimism about the cultural future of society, a pessimism which sprang largely from his visit to the United States between September 1925 and June 1926. He recounted his experiences in ''Jesting Pilate'' (1926): &quot;The thing which is happening in America is a reevaluation of values, a radical alteration (for the worse) of established standards&quot;, and it was soon after this visit that he conceived the idea of writing a satire of what he had encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''Brave New World'' (1932) as well as ''Island'' (1962) form the cornerstone of Huxley's damning indictment of commercialism based upon goods generally manufactured from other countries. Indeed also, ''Brave New World'' (along with Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and [[Yevgeni Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'') helped form the anti-utopian or dystopian tradition in literature and has become synonymous with a future world in which the human spirit is subject to conditioning and control. ''Island'' acts as an antonym to ''Brave New World''; it is described as &quot;one of the truly great philosophical novels&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; The Times &lt;/ref&gt;

He devoted his time at his small house at Llano in the [[Mojave Desert]] to a life of contemplation, mysticism, and experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs. His suggestions in ''The Doors of Perception'' (1954) that [[mescaline]] and [[lysergic acid]] were 'drugs of unique distinction' which should be exploited for the 'supernaturally brilliant' visionary experience they offered provoked even more outrage than his passionate defense of the [[Bates method]] in ''The Art of Seeing'' (1942). However, the book went on to become a cult text in the psychedelic 1960s, and inspire the name of the rock band [[The Doors]]. Huxley also appears on the sleeve of [[The Beatles]]' landmark 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''..

== Awards ==
{{Expand|section|date=February 2008}}
In 1959 Aldous Huxley received the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] Award of Merit for the novel ''Brave New World''. He received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1939 for ''After Many a Summer Dies the Swan''.
