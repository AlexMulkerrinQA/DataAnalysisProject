'''Asia''' is the world's largest and most populous [[continent]]. It covers 8.6% of the [[Earth]]'s total surface area (or 29.9% of its land area) and with approximately 4 billion people, it accounts for 60% of the world's current [[human population]]. It is located chiefly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s.

Asia is traditionally defined as part of the [[landmass]] of [[Eurasia]]—with the western portion of the latter occupied by [[Europe]]—lying east of the [[Suez Canal]], [[east]] of the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s. It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]], and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Given its size and diversity, Asia—a [[toponymy|toponym]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—is more a [[human geography|cultural concept]] incorporating a number of [[region]]s and peoples than a [[physical geography|homogeneous physical entity]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia Asia]&quot;. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 2006. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;&quot;[http://www.answers.com/topic/asia-2010#Science_and_Technology_Encyclopedia Asia]&quot;. ''[[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]].'' 2006. New York: McGraw-Hill Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Subregions of Asia]]'', ''[[Asian people]]'').

The wealth of Asia differs widely between, and within, states. This is due to its vast size, and huge range of different cultures, environments, historical ties and government systems. In terms of nominal GDP, [[Japan]] has the largest economy on the continent and the second largest in the world. In [[purchasing power parity]] term, however, the [[People's Republic of China]] has the largest economy in Asia and the second largest in the world.

==Etymology==
The word ''Asia'' originated from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word &quot;Ἀσία&quot;, first attributed to [[Herodotus]] (about 440 BC) in reference to [[Anatolia]] or, for the purposes of describing the Persian Wars, to the Persian Empire, in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names are used to describe one enormous and substantial land mass ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] but that the Lydians say it was named after Asias, son of Cotys who passed the name on to a tribe in Sardis.

Even before Herodotus, [[Homer]] knew of a Trojan ally named [[Asios Hyrtakides|Asios]] and elsewhere he describes a marsh as ασιος (Iliad 2, 461). The [[Greek language]] term may be derived from [[Assuwa]], a 14th century BC confederation of states in Western [[Anatolia]]. Hittite ''assu-''—&quot;good&quot; is probably an element in that name.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''{{Unicode|(w)aṣû(m)}}'', which means &quot;to go outside&quot; or &quot;to ascend&quot;, referring to the direction of the [[sun]] at sunrise in the [[Middle East]], and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' &quot;to enter&quot; or &quot;set&quot; (of the sun). However, this etymology is considered doubtful, because it does not explain how the term &quot;Asia&quot; first came to be associated with Anatolia, which is ''west'' of the Semitic-speaking areas, unless they refer to the viewpoint of a [[Phoenicia]]n sailor sailing through the straits between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the Black Sea.

==Definition and boundaries==

[[File:Asia-map.png|thumb|[[Physical map (cartography)|Physical map]] of Asia, excluding [[Southwest Asia]]]]
[[File:two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|[[Two-point equidistant projection]] of Asia]]

Medieval [[Europe]]ans considered Asia as a continent – a distinct landmass. The European concept of the three continents in the [[Old World]] goes back to [[Classical Antiquity]], but during the Middle Ages was notably due to [[Isidore of Sevilla]] (see [[T and O map]]). The demarcation between Asia and Africa (to the southwest) is the [[Isthmus]] of Suez and the [[Red Sea]]. The boundary between Asia and Europe is conventionally considered to run through the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the Black Sea, the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, the [[Ural River]] to its source, and the Ural Mountains to the [[Kara Sea]] near Kara, Russia. While this interpretation of tripartite continents (i.e., of Asia, Europe, and Africa) remains common in modernity, discovery of the extent of Africa and Asia have made this definition somewhat anachronistic. This is especially true in the case of Asia, which would have several [[subregions of Asia|regions]] that would be considered distinct landmasses if these criteria were used (for example, [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] and [[East Asia|Eastern Asia]]).

In the far northeast of Asia, [[Siberia]] is separated from North America by the [[Bering Strait]]. Asia is bounded on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] (specifically, from west to east, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Arabian Sea]], and [[Bay of Bengal]]); on the east by the waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] (including, counterclockwise, the [[South China Sea]], [[East China Sea]], [[Yellow Sea]], [[Sea of Japan]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and [[Bering Sea]]); and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Australia (or [[Oceania]]) is to the southeast.

Some geographers do not consider Asia and Europe to be separate continents,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574726/Asia.html Asia].&quot; ''[[Encarta|MSN Encarta Encyclopedia]]''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as there is no logical physical separation between them.&lt;ref name=McG-H /&gt; For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely “the western excrescence of the continent of Asia.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |title=Geography Is Destiny - The Atlantic (December 2008) |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] – with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass – or of [[Afro-Eurasia]]: geologically, Asia, Europe, and Africa comprise a single continuous landmass (save the Suez Canal) and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and most of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]]s, and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Cherskiy Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

In geography, there are two schools of thought. One school follows historical convention and treats Europe and Asia as different continents, categorizing [[subregion]]s within them for more detailed analysis. The other school equates the word &quot;continent&quot; with a geographical region when referring to Europe, and use the term &quot;region&quot; to describe Asia in terms of physiography. Since, in linguistic terms, &quot;continent&quot; implies a distinct landmass, it is becoming increasingly common to substitute the term &quot;region&quot; for &quot;continent&quot; to avoid the problem of disambiguation altogether.

Given the scope and diversity of the landmass, it is sometimes not even clear exactly what &quot;Asia&quot; consists of. Some definitions exclude [[Turkey]], the Middle East, [[Central Asia]], and Russia while only considering the Far East, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent to compose Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Welty, Paul Thomas.

April 26, 2007. page 71 [http://socialtext.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/24/1_86/55.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes used more strictly in reference to the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, which does not include the Middle East or Russia,&lt;ref&gt;BBC News 2006. September 9, 2006. &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; but does include islands in the Pacific Ocean—a number of which may also be considered part of [[Australasia]] or [[Oceania]], although Pacific Islanders are commonly not considered Asian.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Book of English Usage.

{{main|Economy of Asia}}
{{see also|List of regions by past GDP (PPP)}}

Asia has the third largest [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] GDP of all continents, after North America and Europe, but the largest when measured in [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]. As of 2007, the largest national economy within Asia, in terms of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), is that of [[Economy of China|China]] followed by that of [[Japan]], [[India]], [[South Korea]] and [[Indonesia]]. However, in nominal (exchange value) terms, they rank as follows: Japan, China, India, South Korea, [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]]. Since the 1960s, South Korea had maintained the highest economic growth rate in Asia, nicknamed as an [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian tiger]], becoming a [[newly industrialized country]] in the 1980s and a [[developed country]] by the 21st century. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of the PRC&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=916768 Five Years of China's WTO Membership. EU and US Perspectives on China's Compliance with Transparency Commitments and the Transitional Review Mechanism], Legal Issues of Economic Integration, Kluwer Law International, Volume 33, Number 3, pp. 263-304, 2006. by [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=629289 Paolo Farah]&lt;/ref&gt; and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very high growth nations in Asia include [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], [[Uzbekistan]] and mineral-rich nations such as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Iran]], [[Brunei]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Oman]].

During the [[1st millennium]], India had the largest GDP at approximately 30% of the global GDP. By 1500 China had surpassed India; however, over the next four centuries the two were to alternate between 1st and 2nd largest GDP, until the [[British Empire]] (excluding [[British India|India]]) overtook them both in the mid-19th century. Japan has had for only several dacades after WW2 the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the [[Soviet Union]] (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or [[APEC]]). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined. In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equalled that of the USA to tie as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 [[Japanese yen|yen]]/[[US dollar|dollar]]. Economic growth in Asia since [[World War II]] to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the [[Pacific Rim]], known as the [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian tigers]], which have now all received developed country status, having the highest [[GDP per capita]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emergingdragon.com/ Rise of Japan and 4 Asian Tigers from emergingdragon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is forecasted that the [[People's Republic of China]] will surpass [[Japan]] to have the largest nominal and PPP-adjusted GDP in Asia within a decade. [[India]] is also forecast to overtake Japan in terms of Nominal GDP by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcglobal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=507|title=Commonwealth Business Council-Asia|dateformat=mdy|accessdate=April 12 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of GDP per capita, both nominal and PPP-adjusted, South Korea will become the second wealthiest country in Asia by 2025, overtaking Germany, the United Kingdom and France. By 2050, according to a 2006 report by Price Waterhouse Cooper, China will have the largest economy in the world (43% greater than the United States when PPP adjusted, although perhaps smaller than the United States in nominal terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4770590.stm|title=China to dwarf G7 states by 2050|dateformat=mdy|accessdate=November 19 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
Asia is the largest continent in the [[world]] by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as [[petroleum]], [[forest]]s, fish, water, rice, copper, and silver.

===Manufacturing===
Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in mainland [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[India]] and [[Singapore]]. [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporations]], but increasingly mainland [[China]], and [[India]] are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

===Financial and other services===
Asia has four main financial centres: [[Tokyo]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Shanghai]]. [[Call centre]]s and [[business process outsourcing]] (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India, Pakistan and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly-skilled, [[Anglophone|English-speaking]] workers. The increased use of [[outsourcing]] has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centres. Due to its large and extremely competitive [[information technology]] industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

==Early history==
{{main|History of Asia}}
[[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|300px|thumb|Map of Asia in [[1890]]]]
[[File:Asia 1892 amer ency brit.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Asia, 1892]]
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], linked by the interior mass of the [[Central Asia]]n [[steppes]].

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]], and the [[Huanghe River|Huanghe]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states, and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate, and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

==Languages and literature==
{{main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

===Nobel prizes===
[[File:Tagore3.jpg|thumb|Rabindranath Tagore|[[Rabindranath Tagore]], the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]]]]
[[File:CVRaman.jpg|thumb|Sir C.V.Raman|[[C. V. Raman]], the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] in Sciences]]

The [[polymath]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]], a [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] poet, [[drama]]tist, and writer from [[Santiniketan]], now in [[West Bengal]], India, became in 1913 the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]]. He won his [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on [[English literature|English]], [[French literature|French]], and other national literatures of Europe and the [[Americas]]. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.

Tagore is said to have named another Bengali Indian Nobel prize winner, the 1998 laureate in Economics, [[Amartya Sen]]. Sen's work has centered around global issues including famine, welfare, and third-world development. Amartya Sen was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge University, UK, from 1998-2004, becoming the first Asian to head an 'Oxbridge' College.

Other Asian writers who won Nobel Prizes include [[Yasunari Kawabata]] (Japan, 1966), [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] (Japan, 1994), [[Gao Xingjian]] (People's Republic of China, 2000) and [[Orhan Pamuk]] (Turkey, 2006).

Also, [[Mother Teresa]] of India and [[Shirin Ebadi]] of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from [[Burma]] for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma(Myanmar), and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a [[Buddhist]] and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

Sir [[C. V. Raman|C.V.Raman]] is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] &quot;for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the [[Raman scattering|effect named after him]]&quot;.

Other Asian Nobel Prize winners include [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], [[Abdus Salam]], [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], [[Robert Aumann]], [[Menachem Begin]], [[Aaron Ciechanover]], [[Avram Hershko]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Yaser Arafat]], [[Jose Ramos Horta]] and Bishop [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]] of [[Timor Leste]] and [[Kim Dae-jung]]. Most of the said awardees are from [[Israel]] except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Salam (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories), and Kim (South Korea).

In 2006, Dr. [[Mohammad Yunus]] of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of [[Grameen Bank]], a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitutes with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.

The Dalai Lama has received numerous awards over his spiritual and political career.[129] On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada. On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom. Most notable was the Nobel Peace Prize, presented in Oslo on 10 December 1989

==Beliefs==
===Mythology===
{{See also|List of Asian mythology}}
Asian mythology is diverse. The story is first found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] tells about an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu|God Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] of a terrible flood. In ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Shan Hai Jing]], the Chinese ruler [[King Yu of Xia of China|Da Yu]], had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess [[Nüwa]] who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.

===Religions===
{{see also|Eastern philosophy|Religion in Asia}}
Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of material world. [[Christianity]] is also present in most Asian countries.

====Abrahamic====
The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] originated in [[West Asia]]. Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel (which has the second largest [[Jewish]] population in the world), though small communities exist in other countries, such as the [[Bene Israel]] in India. In the Philippines and [[East Timor]], [[Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the [[Spain|Spaniards]] and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], respectively. In [[Armenia]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is the predominant religion. Various [[Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India. The world's largest Muslim community (within the bounds of one nation) is in Indonesia. [[South Asia]] (mainly [[Pakistan]], India and [[Bangladesh]]) holds 30% of Muslims. There are also significant Muslim populations in China, [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], southern [[Philippines]], Russia and most of West Asia and [[Central Asia]].

====Dharmic &amp; Taoist====
The [[religions]] of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.
