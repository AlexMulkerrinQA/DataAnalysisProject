'''''Animal Farm''''' is a [[dystopian]] novel by [[George Orwell]]. Published in [[England]] on 17 August [[1945 in literature|1945]], the book reflects events leading up to and during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Stalin era]] before [[World War II]]. Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945-1950'' p.23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]] for many years, was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and was suspicious of [[Moscow]]-directed [[Stalinism]] after his experiences with the [[NKVD]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as his novel &quot;contre Stalin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot; /&gt;

The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story'', but ''A Fairy Story'' was dropped by the US publishers for its 1946 publication. Of all the translations during Orwell's lifetime, only [[Telugu]] kept the original title. Other variations in the title include: ''A Satire'' and ''A Contemporary Satire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot; /&gt; Orwell suggested for the [[French language|French]] translation the title ''Union des républiques socialistes animales'', recalling the French name of the [[Soviet Union]], ''Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques'', and which abbreviates URSA, which means &quot;bear&quot; in Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot; /&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gr|Grossman 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is also included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]].

== Overview ==

The novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders but also how wickedness, indifference, ignorance, greed and [[Myopia#Myopia as metaphor|myopia]] destroy any possibility of a Utopia. While this novel portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution (and not the act of revolution itself), it also shows how potential ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if smooth transition to a people's government isn't satisfied.

== Characters==

{{Article issues|section=July 2009|original research=April 2009|citecheck=July 2009|refimprove=June 2009}}

The events and characters in Animal Farm satirise [[Communism]] (&quot;[[Animalism (Animal Farm)|Animalism]]&quot;), [[authoritarian]] government and human gullibility generally; Snowball is seen as [[Leon Trotsky]] and the head pig, Napoleon, is [[Stalin]].

=== Pigs ===

; [[Old Major]]
: A prize [[List of domestic pig breeds|Middle White boar]] is the inspiration that fuels the Rebellion in the book. According to one interpretation, he could be based upon both [[Karl Marx]], founder of modern [[Marxism]] and the base for [[Communism]], (in that he describes the ideal society the animals could create if the humans are overthrown) and [[Vladimir Lenin]] (in that his skull is put on revered public display, as was [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Lenin's embalmed corpse]]). However, according to [[Christopher Hitchens]]: &quot;the persons of Lenin and Trotsky are combined into one [i.e., Snowball], or, it might even be [...] to say, there is no Lenin at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchens&quot;&gt;{{cite|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=Why Orwell Matters|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|pages=186-187|ISBN=978-0465030491|date=17 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]]

: &quot;A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon is the main tyrant and villain of ''Animal Farm''; he is based upon [[Joseph Stalin]]. He begins to gradually build up his power, using puppies he took from their parents, the dogs Jessie and Bluebell, and which he raises to be vicious dogs, as his [[secret police]]. After driving Snowball off the farm, Napoleon usurps full power, using false propaganda from Squealer and threats and intimidation from the dogs to keep the other animals in line. Among other things, he gradually changes the Commandments for his benefit. By the end of the book, Napoleon and his fellow pigs have learned to walk upright and started to behave similarly to the humans against whom they originally revolted.

: In the first French version of ''Animal Farm'', Napoleon is called ''{{lang|fr|César}}'', the French spelling of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot;&gt;[[#Dav|Davison 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt; although another translation has him as ''{{lang|fr|Napoléon}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NapoleonInFrench&quot;&gt;{{citation |publisher=Edition Gallimard|collection=Folio|isbn=978-2-07-037516-5|date=1981|author=Jean Quéval |title=La ferme des animaux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]]

: Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. He is probably an allusion to [[Leon Trotsky]], although given Orwell's opinion of Trotsky he could be interpreted as representing the [[Menshevik]]s. He wins over most animals and gains their trust by leading a very successful first harvest, but is driven out of the farm by Napoleon. Snowball genuinely works for the good of the farm and the animals and devises plans to help the animals achieve their vision of an [[egalitarian]] utopia, but Napoleon and his dogs chase him from the farm, and Napoleon spreads rumours to make him seem evil and corrupt and that he had secretly sabotaged the animals' efforts to improve the farm. In his biography of Orwell,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite |first=Bernard |last=Crick |authorlink=Bernard Crick| isbn=978-0316161121 |title=Orwell: A Life | date=March 1981 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Crick suggests that Snowball was as much inspired by the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM) leader [[Andrés Nin]] as by Trotsky. Nin was a similarly adept orator and also fell victim to the Communist purges of the Left during the Spanish Civil War.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

; [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]]

: A small fat porker who serves as Napoleon's right hand pig and minister of propaganda. Inspired by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the Soviet paper ''[[Pravda]]'',{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. Squealer manipulates the language to excuse, justify, and extol all of Napoleon's actions. He represents the legal defendants of the propaganda Stalin used to justify his own terrible acts. In all of his work, George Orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language to suit their interests. Squealer limits debate by complicating it and he confuses and disorients, making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly, for example. However, when questions persist, he usually uses the threat of the return of Mr Jones, the former owner of the farm, to justify the pigs' privileges. Squealer uses statistics to convince the animals that life is getting better and better. Most of the animals have only dim memories of life before the revolution; therefore, they are convinced.

; Minimus

: A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of ''Animal Farm'' after the singing of &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned. He represents admirers of Stalin both inside and outside the USSR such as [[Maxim Gorky]]. His name could also be play on Gorky's first name. As Minimus composed the replacement of &quot;Beasts of England&quot;, he may equate to the three main composers of the ''[[National Anthem of the Soviet Union]]'' which replaced ''[[The Internationale]]''&amp;nbsp;– [[Gabriel El-Registan]], [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov]] and [[Sergey Mikhalkov]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

; The Piglets

: Hinted to be the children of Napoleon (albeit not truly noted in the novel) and are the first generation of animals actually subjugated to his idea of animal inequality. They could also interpreted as the generation raised under Lenin's regime.

; The young pigs

: Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed.

; Pinkeye

: A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

=== Humans ===

; [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]]

: The former owner of the farm, who represents [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the deposed [[Czar]], who had been facing severe financial difficulties in the days leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 Revolution]]. The character is also a nod towards [[Louis XVI]]. There are several implications that he represents an [[autocratic]] but ineffective [[capitalism|capitalist]], incapable of running the farm and looking after the animals properly. Jones is a very heavy drinker and the animals revolt against him after he drinks so much that he does not feed or take care of them.

: The attempt by Jones and his farmhands to recapture the farm is foiled in the '''Battle of the Cowshed''' (the [[Russian Civil War]]).

; [[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]]

: The tough owner of Pinchfield, a well-kept neighbouring farm. He represents [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in general.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Cliff notes page 39 does not connect Frederick  with Hitler; please provide precise page number and quote}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliff39&quot;&gt;[[#Mo|Moran page 39]]&lt;/ref&gt; He buys wood from the animals for forged money and later attacks them, destroying the windmill but being finally beaten in the resulting '''Battle of the Windmill''', which could be interpreted as either the [[Battle of Moscow]] or the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. There are also stories of him mistreating his own animals, such as throwing dogs into a furnace, which may also represent the Nazi Party's treatment of political dissidents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

; [[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]]

: The easy-going but crafty owner of Foxwood, a neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds, as described in the book. He represents the [[Anglosphere]], the [[British Empire]] and the [[United States]]. The card game at the very end of the novel is a [[metaphor]] for the [[Tehran Conference]], where the parties flatter each other, all the while cheating at the game. This last scene is ironic because all the Pigs are civil and kind to the humans, defying all for which they had fought. This happened at the Tehran Conference: the Soviet Union formed an alliance with the United States and the United Kingdom, capitalist countries that the Soviet Union had fought in the early years of the revolution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Cliff notes page 39 does not mention Tehran; please provide precise page number and quote that supports the preceding opinion}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliff39&quot; /&gt; At the end of the game, both Napoleon and Pilkington draw the Ace of Spades and then begin fighting loudly, symbolising the beginning of tension between east and west.

; Mr. Whymper

: A man hired by Napoleon for the public relations of Animal Farm to human society. He is loosely based on Western intellectuals such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and, especially, [[Lincoln Steffens]], who visited the USSR in 1919.

=== Equines ===

There are four main [[equine]] (horse and donkey) characters: '''Clover''', '''Boxer''', '''Benjamin''', and '''Mollie'''.

; [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]]

: One of the main characters, he is the symbol of the working class, or [[proletariat]]: loyal, kind, dedicated, respectful and physically the strongest animal on the farm, but naïve and slow. His ignorance and blind trust towards his leaders leads to his death and their profit. In particular, his heroic physical work represents the [[Stakhanovite]] movement. His maxim of &quot;I will work harder&quot; is reminiscent of Jurgis Rudkus from the [[Upton Sinclair]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]''. His second maxim, &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot; is an example of the propaganda used by Squealer to control the animals. It was not adopted until later in the book. Boxer's work ethic is often praised by the pigs, and he is set as a prime example to the other animals. When Boxer is injured, and can no longer work, Napoleon sends him off to the knacker's yard and deceives the other animals, saying that Boxer died peacefully in the hospital and that the ambulance was an old knacker's van that hadn't been repainted.

; Clover

: Boxer's companion, who is also a [[draught horse]]. She helps and cares for Boxer when he splits his hoof. She blames herself for forgetting the original [[Seven Commandments]] when Squealer had actually revised them. Clover is compassionate, as is shown when she protects the baby ducklings during Major's speech. She is also upset when animals are executed by the dogs, and is held in great respect by the three younger horses who ultimately replace Boxer. Beyond being the matriarch she may also represent the general populace of the Russian Empire that didn't believe in the Marxist rhetoric but did nothing to stop it.

; Mollie

: A self-centred and vain white mare who likes wearing ribbons in her mane, eating sugar cubes (which represent luxury) and being pampered and groomed by humans. She represents upper-class people, the [[bourgeois]] and [[Russian nobility|nobility]] who fled to the West after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and effectively dominated the [[Russian diaspora]]. Accordingly, she quickly leaves for another farm and is only once mentioned again. She is one of the only characters to survive.

; [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]]

: A wise old donkey who shows little emotion and is one of the longest-lived animals; he is still alive at the end of the book. The animals often ask him about his lack of expression but he always answers with: 'Donkeys live a long time. None of you have ever seen a dead donkey.' Benjamin can also read as well as any pig, but rarely displays his ability. He is a dedicated friend to Boxer and is very upset when Boxer is taken away. Benjamin has known about the pigs' wrongdoing the entire time, but he says nothing to the other animals. He represents the cynics in society. Another possibility is that Benjamin is an allegory for intellectuals who have the wisdom to stay clear of the purges, but take no action themselves, such as pacifists, whose attitude Orwell firmly disliked. Yet another possibility is that Benjamin is Orwell himself. Benjamin could also be seen as those who lived during the dominion of the Czar and saw no reality in, or were highly cynical of, the utopian society promised by the Bolsheviks and the later Soviet government.

=== Other animals ===

; Muriel

: A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read (with some difficulty, she has to spell the words out first) and helps Clover discover that the Seven Commandments have been continually changed. She possibly represents the same category as Benjamin, though she dies near the end of the book from old age.

; The Puppies

: Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, raised by Napoleon to be his security force, and may be reference to the fact that Stalin's rise to power was helped by his appointment as General Secretary of the Communist Party by Lenin in 1922, in which role he used his powers of appointment, promotion and demotion to quietly pack the party with his own supporters. The puppies represent Stalin's [[NKVD|secret police]] or the [[KGB]].

; Moses the Raven

: An old bird that occasionally goes to the farm with tales of a place in the sky called Sugarcandy Mountain, where he says animals go when they die, but only if they work hard. He spends time turning the animals' minds to Sugarcandy Mountain and he does no work. He represents religious leaders, specifically the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and Sugarcandy Mountain is Heaven. He also represents [[Rasputin]] being loyal to the Tzar (Mr. Jones). Religion is banned in the new régime, and his religious persona is exacerbated by the fact that he is named after [[Moses|a biblical character]]. He feels unequal in comparison to the other animals, so he leaves after the rebellion, for all animals were supposed to be equal. However, much later in the book he returns to the farm and continues to proclaim the existence of Sugarcandy Mountain. The other animals are confused by the pigs' attitude towards Moses; they denounce his claims as nonsense, but allow him to remain on the farm. The pigs do this to offer the hope of a happy afterlife to the other animals, probably to keep their minds on Sugarcandy Mountain and not on possible uprisings. In the end, Moses is one of few animals to remember the rebellion, along with Clover, Benjamin, and the pigs.

; The Sheep

: Represent the mass proletariat, manipulated to support Napoleon in spite of his treachery. They show limited understanding of the situations but support him anyway, and regularly chant &quot;Four legs good, Two legs bad&quot;. At the end of the novel, one of the Seven Commandments is changed after the pigs learn to walk on two legs, so they shout &quot;Four legs good, two legs better&quot;. They can be relied on by the pigs to shout down any dissent from others.

; The Rats

: Represent some of the nomadic people in the far east of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, Soviet Union), most notably the Union Republics of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]].

; The Hens

: Represent the [[Kulak]]s. They destroy their eggs instead of handing them to the higher powers, just as during [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]] some Kulaks [[sabotage]]d machinery or killed their livestock.

; The Cows

: Represent the proletariat, whose milk is greedily stolen by the pigs as a luxury, and is not shared out equally.

; The Cat

: Represents those who insincerely adhere to ideology for exploitation and personal gain, shown in her promise to the birds that they are 'comrades' and they are safe to land in her paw.

== Origin ==

George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 following his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in his 1938 ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.

In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of Animal Farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him &quot;how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.&quot; This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original [[socialism|socialist]] ideals.&lt;ref name=&quot;GO47&quot;&gt;[[#Or|Orwell 1947]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In that preface Orwell also described what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm:&lt;ref name=&quot;GO47&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.}}

Orwell encountered great difficulty getting the manuscript published. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting with the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dag 2004&quot;&gt;[[#Dag|Dag 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.

== Significance ==

[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]].]]

In the [[Eastern Bloc]] both ''Animal Farm'' and later, also ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' were on the list of forbidden books up until ''[[die Wende]]'' in 1989, and were only available via clandestine [[Samizdat]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Farm_der_Tiere&amp;oldid=57516949 Editors of German Wikipedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1947 Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|by whom? The British socialist party?}} It was printed to be distributed among the Soviet citizens of Ukraine who were some of the many millions of [[displaced persons]] throughout Europe at the end of the Second World War. The American occupation forces considered the edition to be propaganda printed on illegal presses, and handed 1,500 confiscated copies of ''Animal Farm'' over to the Soviet authorities.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|when?}} The politics in the book also affected the UK, with Orwell reporting that [[Ernest Bevin]] was &quot;terrified&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Herbert Read]], 18 August, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; that it may cause embarrassment if published before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].

In recent years,{{When|date=March 2009}} the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organisation, only eventually to become corrupt and oppressive themselves as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo|the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], whose succeeding African-born rulers were accused of being as corrupt as, or worse than, the European colonists they supplanted.

The novel's ''Battle of the Windmill'' is referred to by Sant Singh Bal{{Who|date=August 2009}} as one &quot;of the important episodes which constitute the essence of the plot of the novel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sant Singh Bal, ''George Orwell'' (1981), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Bloom writes that the &quot;Battle of the Windmill rings a special bell: the repulse of the Duke of Brunswick in 1792, following the Prussian bombardment that made the windmill of [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] famous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harold Bloom 2007&quot;&gt;Harold Bloom, ''George Orwell'' (2007), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Peter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Hobley Davison consider that in real life, with events in ''Animal Farm'' mirroring those in the [[Soviet Union]], this fictional battle represents the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot;&gt;Peter Edgerly Firchow, ''Modern Utopian Fictions from H.G. Wells to Iris Murdoch'' (2008), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;), especially the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot;&gt;Peter Hobley Davison, ''George Orwell'' (1996), 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Prestwick House's ''Activity Pack'' for ''Animal Farm'' also identifies the Battle of the Windmill as an allegory for World War II, while noting that the &quot;catalyst for the Battle of the Windmill, though, is less clear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''Animal Farm - Activity Pack'' (Prestwick House, Inc., 2004), T-3, T-23, S-23.&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Fredrick drills a hole and places [[explosive]]s inside, and it is followed by &quot;All the animals, except Napoleon&quot; took cover; Orwell had the publisher alter this from &quot;All the animals, including Napoleon&quot; in recognition of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Conrad and Paul Kirschner, ''Under Western Eyes'' (1996), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' represents the allied invasion of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot;/&gt;, and the defeat of the White Russians in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot;/&gt;

== Efforts to find a publisher ==

During [[World War II]] it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch&amp;nbsp;— including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) also rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising its &quot;good writing&quot; and &quot;fundamental integrity&quot; but declaring that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint &quot;which I take to be generally Trotskyite&quot;. Eliot said he found the view &quot;not convincing&quot;, and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue &quot;what was needed .. was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot&quot;&gt;Richard
Brooks, &quot;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5993099.ece TS Eliot’s snort of rejection for Animal Farm]&quot;, ''Sunday Times'', 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S.

Eliot rejection letter|publisher=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One publisher he sought during the war, who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected his book after an official at the British [[UK Ministry of Information|Ministry of Information]] warned him off&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7719633.stm |title=The whitewashing of Stalin|publisher=''BBC News''|date=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ta|Taylor page 337]] Writing to Leonard Moore, a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher &quot;Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable: and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. The 'important official' was, or so it may reasonably be assumed, a man named [[Peter Smollett]], later unmasked as a Soviet agent.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher then wrote to Orwell, saying:&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.

Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.}}

Although it was written in 1943, ''Animal Farm'' was not published until 1945 due to paper rationing and fear of damaging the Anglo-Soviet alliance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot; ==

Orwell originally wrote a preface which complains about self-imposed British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally. &quot;The sinister fact about literary [[censorship]] in England is that it is largely voluntary.&amp;nbsp;... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.&quot; The preface itself was censored and as of June 2009 has not been published with most editions of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dag 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ba|Bailey83221]] (Bailey83221 includes a preface and two cites: 1995-08-26 The Guardian page 28; 1995-08-26 New Statesman &amp; Society 8 (366): 11. ISSN: 0954-2361)&lt;/ref&gt; His wife [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy|Eileen Blair]] had worked during the war at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] censoring newspapers.

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of Animal Farm in 1945 without any introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOIT15&quot;&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell page 15]]. introduction by Bernard Crick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TFOTP&quot;&gt;George Orwell: ''[http://www.orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go The Freedom of the Press – Orwell's Proposed Preface to 'Animal Farm’.]'' 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, in 1972, Ian Angus found the original typescript titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;, and Bernard Crick published it, together with his own introduction in [[The Times Literary Supplement]] on 15 September 1972&lt;ref name=&quot;GOIT15&quot; /&gt; as &quot;How the essay came to be written&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TFOTP&quot; /&gt; Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name=&quot;TFOTP&quot; /&gt; The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 Animal Farm edition, with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOIT15&quot; /&gt; Other publishers were still declining to publish it.

On July 17, 2009, [[Amazon.com]] withdrew certain [[Amazon Kindle]] titles, including ''Animal Farm'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], from sale, refunded buyers, and remotely deleted items from purchasers' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/ Some E-Books Are More Equal Than Others]&lt;/ref&gt; Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last = Stone| first = Brad| title = Amazon Erases Orwell Books From Kindle| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = B1| year = 2009| date = July 18, 2009| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html?_r=1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;.
