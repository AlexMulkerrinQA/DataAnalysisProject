Generally, an '''answer''' is a reply to a question or is a solution, a retaliation, or a response.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

In law, an '''answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to some one or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a [[reply]] to a [[question]] or [[objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Answer Answer - LoveToKnow 1911&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[common law]], an '''answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]].

The ''answer'' establishes which allegations ([[cause of action]] in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant's [[Defense (legal)|defenses]], thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the [[court]].

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either [[guilt]]y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or a permanent [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentium'' (&quot;answers of the learned ones&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman [[lawyer]]s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Answer Answer - LoveToKnow 1911&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In music an &quot;'''answer'''&quot; (also known as [[countersubject]]) is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition or modification by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;
