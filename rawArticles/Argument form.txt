      In [[logic]], the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of an [[argument]] results from replacing the different words, or sentences, that make up the argument with letters, along the lines of [[algebra]]; the letters represent logical ''[[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. This is of importance since the [[validity]] of an argument is determined solely by its form. The ''sentence forms'' which classify argument forms of common important arguments are studied in [[logic]].

== Example ==
To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.
;Original argument
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
;Argument Form
:All ''S'' are ''P''.
:''a'' is ''S''.
:Therefore, ''a'' is ''P''.

All we have done in the ''Argument form'' is to put 'S' for 'human' and 'humans', 'P' for 'mortal', and 'a' for 'Socrates'; what results, is the ''form'' of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the ''Argument form'' is the ''sentence form'' of its respective sentence in the original argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Patrick J.|title=A concise introduction to logic|publisher=Wadsworth Pub.

==Importance==
Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[validity|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. Some examples of valid argument forms are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and the [[disjunctive syllogism]]. Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]].
