An '''astronaut''' or '''cosmonaut''' is a person trained by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]].
While generally reserved for professional space travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf|title=Astronaut Fact Book|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2006|author=[[NASA]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;utah&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784|title=Former astronaut visits USU|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=The Utah Statesman|year=2005|author=Marie MacKay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2003, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military, or by civilian space agencies. However, with the sub-orbital flight of the privately-funded [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

The criteria for what constitutes human [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] vary.

== Terminology ==
{{see also|Astronaut ranks and positions}}

In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other [[English language|English]]-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an ''astronaut''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54]&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning &quot;star&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. The first known use of the term &quot;astronaut&quot; in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story ''The Death's Head Meteor'' in 1930. The word itself had been known earlier. For example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', &quot;astronaut&quot; referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) of [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by &quot;aeronaut&quot;, an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists.

NASA applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its Astronaut Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Dismukes  | first = Kim - NASA Biography Page Curator | title = Astronaut Biographies | publisher = [[Johnson Space Center]],NASA |author=NASA|date = 2005-12-15| url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| accessdate = 2007-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its Astronaut Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESApage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first = | title = The European Astronaut Corps | publisher = [[ESA]] |author=ESA |date = 2008-04-10| url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| accessdate = 2008-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[space tourism]], [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to use the term &quot;[[spaceflight participant]]&quot; to distinguish those space travelers from astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

===Russia===
{{main|Soviet space program}}
[[Image:Yuri Gagarin official portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Yuri Gagarin]], first person in space (1961).]]
By convention, an astronaut employed by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor) is called a ''cosmonaut'' in English texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot; /&gt; The word is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''kosmonavt'' ({{lang-ru|космона́вт}} {{IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaft}}), which in turn derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning &quot;universe&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. For the most part, &quot;cosmonaut&quot; and &quot;astronaut&quot; are synonyms in all languages, and the usage of choice is often dictated by political reasons.

On March 14, 1995, [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, arguably becoming the first &quot;American cosmonaut&quot; in the process.

===China===
{{main|Chinese space program|list of Chinese astronauts}}
Official English-language texts issued by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] use ''astronaut'' while texts in Russian use ''космонавт'' (''kosmonavt'').&lt;ref name=&quot;rus&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/ceka/rus/xwdt/t216370.htm|title=Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan press-release|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=fmprc.gov.cn|author=реконмендовать другому|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rus2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ru.china-embassy.org/rus/xwdt/t73142.htm|title=Chinese embassy in Russia press-release|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=ru.china-embassy.org|author=ru.china-embassy.org|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[People's Republic of China|China]], the terms &quot;yǔhángyuán&quot; ({{lang|zh|宇航员}}, &quot;sailing personnel in universe&quot;) or &quot;hángtiānyuán&quot; ({{lang|zh|航天员}}, &quot;sailing personnel in sky&quot;) have long been used for astronauts. The phrase &quot;tàikōng rén&quot; ({{lang|zh|太空人}}, &quot;spaceman&quot;) is often used in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]].

The term ''taikonaut'' is used by some English-language news media organizations for professional [[Chinese space program|space travelers from China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/26/content_7500262.htm|title=Chinese taikonaut dismisses environment worries about new space launch center|date=2008-01-26|accessdate=2008-09-25|publisher=[[China View]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word has featured in the [[Longman]] and [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English]] dictionaries,  the latter of which describes it as &quot;a hybrid of the Chinese term ''taikong'' (space) and the Greek ''naut'' (traveller), or astronaut&quot;; the term became more common in 2003 when China sent its first astronaut [[Yang Liwei]] into space aboard the ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/25/content_10111749.htm|title=&quot;Taikonauts&quot; a sign of China's growing global influence|date=2008-09-25|accessdate=2008-09-25|publisher=[[China View]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the term used by Xinhua in the English version of the Chinese People's Daily since the advent of the Chinese space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90881/6507790.html|title=Chinese taikonaut debuts spacewalk|accessdate=September 28 2008|dateformat=mdy|publisher=People's Daily Online|author=Xinhua|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin of the term is unclear; as early as May 1998, Chiew Lee Yih ({{lang|zh|赵里昱}}) from [[Malaysia]], used it in [[newsgroup]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;chiew&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Lee Yih | last=Chiew | coauthors= |date=1998-05-19| title=Google search of &quot;taikonaut&quot; sort by date |url = http://groups.google.com/groups?q=taikonaut&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N&amp;scoring=d&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=24&amp;as_maxm=5&amp;as_maxy=1998&amp;safe=off&amp; | work = Usenet posting | publisher = Chiew Lee Yih | author=Chiew Lee Yih| accessdate = 2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chiew2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Lee Yih | last=Chiew |date=1996-03-10| coauthors= | title=Chiew Lee Yih misspelled &quot;taikonaut&quot; 2 years before it first appear |url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.chinese.text/browse_thread/thread/a7f02b9489c59c5b/dd9e7a1b78d7d5c7?hl=en&amp;lnk=st&amp;q=taikonout#dd9e7a1b78d7d5c7 | work = Usenet posting | publisher = Chiew Lee Yih | author=Chiew Lee Yih| accessdate = 2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;evilmonkeyontaikonaut&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Monkey | last=Evil| coauthors= | title=    The earliest use of the term found in Google Groups is on that date.[1] Evil Monkey → Talk 03:07, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)  |url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Astronaut#Taikonaut_probably_not_coined_by_Chiew_Lee_Yih | work = Wikipedia discussion on astronaut |date=2005-01-24| publisher = Evil Monkey | author=Evil Monkey| accessdate = 2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chen Lan ({{lang|zh|陈蓝}}), almost simultaneously, announced it at his &quot;Go Taikonauts!&quot; GeoCities page.&lt;ref name=&quot;chenlan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Go Taikonauts! |url = http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/1921/ | publisher = Chen Lan | author=Chen Lan|year=1998|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other terms===
While no nation other than [[Russia]] (formerly the Soviet Union), the United States, and China has launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term ''spationaut'' (French spelling: ''spationaute'') is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the [[Latin]] word ''spatium'' or &quot;space&quot;, and the [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''angkasawan'' was used to describe participants in the [[Angkasawan program]].

{{see also|Astronaut ranks and positions}}
The first NASA astronauts were selected in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aerospacescholars.jsc.nasa.gov/HAS/cirr/ss/3/3.cfm|title=Astronaut Candidate Training|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=2006|author=NASA}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in the space program, military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at NASA, although neither John Glenn nor Scott Carpenter (of the [[Mercury Seven]]) had any university degree, in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection.  Selection was initially limited to military pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html|title=Selection and Training of Astronauts|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=1995|author=NASA}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nolen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Nolen, Stephanie |title=Promised The Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race |publisher=Penguin Canada |location=Toronto |year=2002 |page=235 |isbn=0-14-301347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest astronauts for both America and Russia tended to be [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]] pilots, and were often test pilots.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through 20 months of training in a variety of areas, including training for [[extra-vehicular activity]] in a facility such as NASA's [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot; /&gt; Astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of [[weightlessness]] in aircraft called the &quot;[[vomit comet]]&quot;, the nickname given to a pair of modified [[KC-135]]s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]) which perform [[parabolic]] flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot; /&gt; Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in [[T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft]] out of [[Ellington Field]], due to its proximity to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].  Ellington Field is also where the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are done out of [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

===NASA candidacy requirements===
* Be citizens of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;program&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/content/broch00.htm|title=Astronaut Candidate Program|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pass a strict physical examination, and have a near and distant visual acuity correctable to 20/20 (6/6). Blood pressure, while sitting, must be no greater than 140 over 90.

====Commander and Pilot====
* A [[bachelor's degree]] in [[engineering]], [[Biology|biological science]], [[physical science]] or [[mathematics]] is required.
* At least 1,000 hours flying time as pilot-in-command in jet aircraft. Experience as a test pilot is desirable.
* Height must be 5 ft 4 in to 6 ft 4 in (1.63 to 1.93 m).
* Distant visual acuity must be correctable to 20/20 in each eye
*The refractive surgical procedures of the eye, PRK and LASIK, are now allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no permanent adverse after effects.  For those applicants under final consideration, an operative report on the surgical procedure will be requested.

====Mission Specialist====
* A bachelor's degree in [[engineering]], [[biological science]], [[physical science]] or [[mathematics]], as well as at least three years of related professional experience. An advanced degree can substitute for part or all of the experience requirement (master's degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years)
*Applicant's height must be 5 ft 2 in to 6 ft 4 in (1.57 to 1.93 m).

====Mission Specialist Educator====

{{main|Educator Astronaut Project}}
* Bachelor's degree with teaching experience, including work at the kindergarten through 12th grade level. Advanced degree not required, but is desired.&lt;ref name=&quot;announce&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/sep/HQ_07196_astronaut_recruitment.html|title=NASA Opens Applications for New Astronaut Class|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Educator Astronaut Project|Mission Specialist Educators]], or &quot;Educator Astronauts&quot;, were first selected in 2004, and as of 2007, there are three NASA Educator astronauts: [[Joseph M. Acaba]], [[Richard R. Arnold]], and [[Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nexgen&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/preparingtravel/ascan2004.html|title='Next Generation of Explorers' Named|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=2004|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ed&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/oct/HQ_n04160_new_ascans.html|title=NASA's New Astronauts Meet The Press|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy| publisher=NASA| year=2004| author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Barbara Morgan]], selected as back-up teacher to [[Christa McAuliffe]] in 1985, is considered to be the first Educator astronaut by the media, but she trained as a mission specialist.&lt;ref name=&quot;morgan1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/morgan.html|title=Barbara Radding Morgan - NASA Astronaut biography|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Educator Astronaut program is a successor to the [[Teacher in Space]] program from the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;fly&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/space_educator_030203.html|title=NASA Assures That Teachers Will Fly in Space |accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=Space.com|year=2007|author=Tariq Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwwedu.ssc.nasa.gov/neap.asp|title=Educator Astronaut Program|accessdate=October 4 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=NASA|year=2005|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
At NASA, people who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut wings|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) in altitude.

==Deaths==
[[Image:amf space mirror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Space Mirror Memorial]]
{{main|Space accidents and incidents}}

As of 2008, eighteen astronauts have lost their lives during spaceflight, on four missions. They include thirteen Americans, three Russians, one Ukrainian, and one Israeli.

The [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] X-15 test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, a civilian spaceflight participant who died in the Challenger disaster, and an international astronaut who was killed in the Columbia disaster.
