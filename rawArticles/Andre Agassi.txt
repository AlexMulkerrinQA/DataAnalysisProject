'''Andre Kirk Agassi''' (born April 29, 1970) is a former [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] professional American [[tennis]] player who won eight [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles tournaments and an [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] in singles.

==Early life==
Agassi was born in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] to [[Emmanuel Agassi|Emmanuel &quot;Mike&quot; Agassi]] and Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Agassi (née Dudley).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/bio/andre_agassi.shtml |title=Andre Agassi Biography |publisher=Netglimpse.com |accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is an Iranian of [[Assyrian People|Assyrian]]&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=5R1y1nvcWccC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=andre+aghassi+assyrian+-wikipedia.org&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MiSYlmHbHG&amp;sig=wMd8xu9J8iOQyv_RuVwJvaJWiyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=48&amp;ct=result&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;persianbio&quot;&gt;http://www.persianmirror.com/culture/famous/bios/andreagassi.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/1995/zn082895.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peoplebio&quot;&gt;http://www.peopleandprofiles.com/ProfilesDet-28/Andre+Agassi.html?profile_id=127&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Armenians|Armenian]] ethnicity who represented [[Iran]] in [[boxing]] at the [[Iran at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[Iran at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] [[Olympic Games]] before emigrating to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen|first1=Jeffry |editor1-first=Dawn P |editor1-last=Dawson|title=Great Athletes |edition=Revised|volume=1|year=2002|origyear=1992 |publisher=Salem Press|isbn=1-58765-008-8|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andre Agassi's mother, Betty, is a [[breast cancer]] survivor.

Mike Agassi was renowned for his domineering nature, reportedly taking a hammer to matches and banging on the fences in disgust when Andre lost a point. He sometimes screamed at officials and was ejected more than once. At age 13, Andre was sent to [[Nick Bollettieri]]'s Tennis Academy in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He was meant to stay for only eight weeks because that was all his father could afford. However, after ten minutes of watching Agassi rally, Bollettieri called Mike and said, &quot;Take your check back. He's here for free&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lxbpdn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/08/30/agassi0717/index.html
|publisher=Gary Smith for Sports Illustrated |title=Coming Into Focus|accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He turned professional at the age of 16. His first tournament was in [[La Quinta, California]]. He won his first match against [[John Austin (tennis)|John Austin]] 6–4, 6–2 but then lost his second match to [[Mats Wilander]] 6–1, 6–1. By the end of the year, Agassi was ranked World No. 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennis28.com/rankings/history/agassi.html|title=http://www.tennis28.com/rankings/history/agassi.html |accessdate=2009-06-12 |publisher=Tennis28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Early on in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. In 1995, he added a backhand drop shot to his repertoire, which was one of the most effective drop shots on tour {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} (partly due to the fact that Agassi's groundstrokes forced most opponents to play far behind the baseline). On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner. After Agassi's rededication to tennis in 1998, he focused more on physical conditioning than in the past and became one of the fittest players on the tour. He had remarkable endurance and rarely appeared tired on court.
{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} 

Due to his conditioning and groundstrokes, one of Agassi's central strategies was to wear down his opponents. Agassi tried to minimize time between points, so that his opponents had as little recovery time as possible. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} 
Agassi continually put pressure on opponents by returning the ball early and at deep angles, and attempted to dictate play from the center of the baseline and make his opponent scramble. When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a slightly more conservative shot, both to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more. His penchant for running players around point after point has earned him the nickname &quot;The Punisher&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In the last year of his career, various injuries, most notably in his back, robbed Agassi of consistent speed and court coverage. As a result, players who were able to consistently hit at sharp angles with pace, particularly those who could do this on the run, gave him trouble. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} 
To make up for this weakness, Agassi began playing more offensive shots, to keep his opponent on the defensive and deny them opportunities to run Agassi around the court. This both limited his options from the baseline and increased his errors. {{Citation needed|date=July  2009}} Agassi's serve was never the strength of his game, but it improved steadily over the course of his career, and went from being a liability to being above average. He often used his hard slice serve in the deuce service box to seek to send his opponent off the court, followed by a shot to the opponent's opposite corner. Agassi's service speed when hitting a flat first serve would often range between 110mph to 125mph. His second serve however was usually only in the mid 80's. He relied on a heavy kick serve for his second serve. Agassi's fastest serve registered 128 mph during his semi-final match against [[Andy Roddick]] at the 2004 Masters event in Cincinnati. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Tennis career==
===1986–1993===
Agassi turned professional in 1986 and won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the [[Sul American Open]] in [[Itaparica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He ended the year ranked World No. 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, [[1988 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships|U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]], [[World Championship Tennis#WCT 1988|Forest Hills WCT]], Stuttgart Outdoor, [[1988 Volvo International|Volvo International]] and [[1988 Livingston Open|Livingston Open]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; and, by December of that year, he had surpassed [[US$]]2 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments – the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} His year-end ranking was World No. 3, behind second-ranked [[Ivan Lendl]] and top-ranked [[Mats Wilander]].  Both the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and ''Tennis'' magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which would later become his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly white&quot; dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semi-finals of both the [[French Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1988, and the US Open again in 1989. He began the 1990s, however, with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he lost in four sets to [[Andrés Gómez]]. His second Grand Slam final was against [[Pete Sampras]] at the US Open. After that match, he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it. Agassi lost to Sampras 6–4, 6–3, 6–2.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first [[Davis Cup]] in 8 years and won his only [[Tennis Masters Cup]].

In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a five set final. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He went on to reach the quarter-finals on that occasion, losing in five sets to [[David Wheaton]]. 

Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open where he had previously enjoyed success. In 1992, he defeated [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a five set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions in [[Boris Becker]] and [[John McEnroe]]. No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until [[Lleyton Hewitt]] ten years later. Agassi was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi once again played on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team in 1992. It was their second Davis cup title in three years.

1993 saw Agassi win the only doubles title of his career, at the [[Cincinnati Masters]], partnered with [[Petr Korda]]. Agassi missed much of the early part of that year with injuries and struggled at the major events with a first-round exit at the US Open and wrist surgery late in the year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===1994–1997===
With new coach [[Brad Gilbert]] on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. Agassi started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. Nevertheless, Agassi emerged during the hard court season, winning the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]]. His comeback culminated at the [[1994 US Open (tennis)|1994 US Open]] with a 5-set fourth-round victory against compatriot [[Michael Chang]] and then becoming the first man to capture the US Open as an [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|unseeded]] player, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old &quot;image is everything&quot; style. He attended the [[1995 Australian Open]] for the first time and won, beating Sampras in a four set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on [[hardcourt]], with Agassi winning three. Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ([[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], [[Miami Masters|Key Biscayne]], and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hardcourt circuit, which ended when he lost the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] final to Sampras.

Agassi reached the [[World No. 1 (tennis)|World No. 1]] ranking for the first time in April 1995. He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks. In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year. He won 72 matches and lost only 9.  Agassi was also once again a key player on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team - the third and final Davis Cup title of Agassi's career.

1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final. He suffered two early round losses at the hands of compatriots [[Chris Woodruff]] and [[Doug Flach]] at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semifinals. The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of Spain in the final 6–2, 6–3, 6–1.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;  Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.

1997 was the low point of Agassi's career. His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. He won no top-level titles and his ranking sank to World No. 141 on November 10, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He ultimately finished the year ranked World No. 122. 

===1998–2003===
[[Image:Agassi-Auopen2005.jpg|thumb|Agassi serving]]
In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments (a circuit for professional players ranked outside the world's top 50). He played some classic matches in this period, most notably against his rival [[Pete Sampras]] and popular Australian [[Patrick Rafter]].

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from World No. 122 at the start of the year to World No. 6 at the end of it, making it the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a single calendar year.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.atptennis.com/5/en/players/playerprofiles/highlights.asp?playernumber=A092 Andre Agassi player profile]&lt;/ref&gt; He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the [[Miami Masters|Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne]], losing to [[Marcelo Ríos]], who became World No. 1 as a result of winning that tournament.

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat [[Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set [[French Open]] final, thereby becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining [[Rod Laver]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Roy Emerson]], [[Don Budge]] and, the sixth, [[Roger Federer]]) to have won all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles during his career. This win also made him the first (of only two, the second being Roger Federer) male players in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass, and hard courts), a tribute to his adaptability, as the other four men won their Grand Slam titles on clay and grass courts.  Agassi also became the first male player to win the [[Career Golden Slam]], consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal.

Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets (rallying from a 2 sets to 1 deficit) in the final. Agassi ended 1999 as the World No. 1, ending Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;  This was the only time Agassi ended the year at number one.

Agassi began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semifinal and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Federer]] has since duplicated this feat, appearing in ten consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pete Sampras]] held the 1993 [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], 1993 [[1993 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], and [[1994 Australian Open]] titles simultaneously. [[Jimmy Connors]] won all three of those events in 1974, although at the time all three were on [[Tennis court#Grass courts|grass courts]]. [[Mats Wilander]] won all but Wimbledon in 1988 during his similar rise to be the year-end World No. 1. Federer has since duplicated this feat, holding all Grand Slam titles except the [[French Open]] at the end of 2004 as well as throughout 2006 and 2007. [[Rafael Nadal]] won the 2008 French Open, 2008 Wimbledon, and 2009 Australian Open.&lt;/ref&gt;

2000 also saw Agassi reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever played at Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm |title=Classic Matches: Rafter v Agassi |date=2004-05-31 |accessdate=2007-10-25 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the inaugural [[2000 Tennis Masters Cup|Tennis Masters Cup]] in [[Lisbon]], Agassi reached the final after defeating [[Marat Safin]] 6–3, 6–3 in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest World No. 1 in the history of tennis. Agassi then lost to [[Gustavo Kuerten]] in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end World No. 1.

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over [[Arnaud Clément]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Enroute, he beat a cramping Rafter (7–5, 2–6, 6–7, 6–2, 6–3) in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie's last Australian Open. At Wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set.  In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3 hour, 33 minute epic match&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/sampras_agassi Believe the hype]&lt;/ref&gt; with Sampras 6–7(7), 7–6(7), 7–6(2), 7–6(5),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/agassi_sidebar_ap Unbreakable]&lt;/ref&gt; with no breaks of serve during the 48-game match.  Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked World No. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 10 in three different decades&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/tennis/players/playerpage/201490/2006]&lt;/ref&gt; (1980s - finishing World No. 3 in 1988 and No. 7 in 1989; 1990s - finishing World No. 4 in 1990, No. 10 in 1991, No. 9 in 1992, No. 2 in 1994 and 1995, No. 8 in 1996, No. 6 in 1998 and No. 1 in 1999; 2000s - finishing World No. 6 in 2000, No. 3 in 2001, No. 2 in 2002, No. 4 in 2003, No. 8 in 2004 and No. 7 in 2005).  He also was the oldest player (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year old Connors finished at World No. 2 in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion. The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings. The match proved to be the last of Sampras's career. Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, [[Rome Masters|Rome]], and [[Madrid Masters|Madrid]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end World No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Schüttler]] in straight sets in the final. In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive [[Key Biscayne]] title, in the process surpassing his wife, [[Steffi Graf]], who was a 5-time winner of the event. The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993–1995. (Agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to [[Agustín Calleri]].) With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament. On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the World No. 1 ranking after a quarterfinal victory over [[Xavier Malisse]] at the [[Queen's Club Championships]] to become the oldest top ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. He held the World No. 1 ranking for two weeks when [[Lleyton Hewitt]] took it back on May 12, 2003. Agassi then recaptured the World No. 1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003. During his career, Agassi held the World No. 1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenniscorner.net/index.php?corner=m&amp;action=stats&amp;stats=no1 Weeks at Number One]&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events. He did manage to reach the US Open semifinals, where he lost to [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] and surrendered his World No. 1 ranking to Ferrero. At the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked World No. 4. At age 33, he was the oldest player to rank in the top five since Connors, at age 35, was World No. 4 in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

===2004–2006===
In 2004, Agassi won the [[Cincinnati Masters|Masters series event in Cincinnati]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] and [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]]. At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]] who won the title in 1970 at age 35. He finished the year ranked World No. 8, the oldest player to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was World No. 7 in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt; Agassi also became only the sixth male player during the [[open era]] to reach 800 career wins with his first round victory over [[Alex Bogomolov]] in [[Countrywide Classic]] in [[Los Angeles]]. 

Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open. Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. He lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the first round of the French Open. He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] before falling to World No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]]. Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final. After beating [[Răzvan Sabău]] and Ivo Karlovic in straight sets and [[Tomáš Berdych]] in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over [[James Blake]], where he rallied from two sets down to win 3–6, 3–6, 6–3, 6–3, 7–6(6). His other five-set victims were [[Xavier Malisse]] in the fourth round and [[Robby Ginepri]] in the semifinals. In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his fifth Grand Slam title in two years. Federer defeated Agassi in four sets, although Agassi gave him a scare when Agassi was up a break in the third set after splitting the first two sets.

Before the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup in [[Shanghai]], Agassi rolled his ankle in a [[racquetball]] accident and tore several ligaments. He was unable to walk for weeks. He nevertheless committed to the tournament, in which he was seeded third, and played [[Nikolay Davydenko]] in his first round robin match. Agassi's movement was noticeably hindered, particularly on his backhand return of serve, and he lost in straight sets. He then withdrew from the tournament.

Agassi finished 2005 ranked World No. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top 10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end. In 2005, Agassi left [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with [[adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2116135 ESPN - Agassi signs Adidas deal after long-term deal with Nike - Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi had a poor start to 2006. He was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay court season, including the French Open. This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time.

Agassi returned for the grass court season, playing a tune-up and then [[2006 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Singles|Wimbledon]]. He was defeated in the third round by World No. 2 (and eventual runner-up) [[Rafael Nadal]] 7–6(5), 6–2, 6–4. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101 |title=Upsetting day: Agassi, then Roddick ousted |date=2006-06-01|accessdate=2007-10-27 |work=Associated Press|publisher=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open.

Agassi played only two events during the summer hardcourt season, with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles to [[Fernando González]] of Chile 6–4, 3–6, 7–5. As a result, he was unseeded at the US Open.

Agassi had a short but dramatic run in his final US Open. Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. After a tough four-set win against [[Andrei Pavel]], Agassi faced eighth-seeded [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in the second round, who had earlier advanced to the [[2006 Australian Open]] final and Wimbledon semifinals. Agassi won 6–4, 6–4, 3–6, 5–7, 7–5 as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set. In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th ranked big-serving [[Benjamin Becker]] of Germany in four sets. Agassi received an eight minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a [[Andre Agassi#Quotations|memorable retirement speech]].

===Earnings===
Agassi earned more than US$ 30 million in prize-money during his career, third only to Sampras and Federer to date. He also earned more than US $25 million a year through endorsements, during his career and fourth in all sports at the time. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Post retirement===
Since retiring after the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]], Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity. On September 5, 2007, Agassi was a surprise guest commentator for the [[Andy Roddick]]/[[Roger Federer]] [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarterfinal. He will play [[World Team Tennis]] for the [[Philadelphia Freedoms]] in the summer of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/02/26/agassi.ap/index.html Andre Agassi Will Play WTT] SI.com, March 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and will play the [[Outback Champions Series]] event in [[Surprise, Arizona]] in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-ten-agassi-champions-series,0,3589987.story Tour spokesman to AP: Agassi to play Champions Series event in Arizona in October]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and family life==
Agassi married [[actor|actress]] [[Brooke Shields]] on April 19, 1997. In February 1998, they filed suit against ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' claiming it printed &quot;false and fabricated&quot; statements about the couple, but the case was dismissed. The couple later filed for divorce, which was granted on April 9, 1999.

At the 1999 French Open, Agassi and [[Steffi Graf]] were the surprise champions, since he had not won a Grand Slam title since 1995 and she since 1996. At the winners' ball, they danced the traditional champions dance. After that evening, they began dating. Graf retired after they both reached the Wimbledon final in July. They were married on October 22, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101751&amp;page=1 Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf Wed]&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, Jaden Gil, was born four days later, October 26. Their daughter, Jaz Elle, was born on October 3, 2003. The couple lives in the Las Vegas area and own several vacation homes.

Agassi's older sister, Rita, was married to tennis player [[Pancho Gonzales]]. In 1995, when Gonzales died in Las Vegas, Agassi paid for the funeral. Long-time trainer [[Gil Reyes (tennis)|Gil Reyes]] has been called one of Agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a &quot;father figure&quot; for Andre Agassi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1999/year_in_review/flashbacks/father_best/ Father Knew Best]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://safinhantuchova.blogspot.com/2008/07/papa-gil.html Peter Bodo Blog: Papa Gil]&lt;/ref&gt; Andre Agassi's other sister, [http://tennisroundup.com/ofInterest/AgassiCancer.htm Tami], like their mother, Betty Agassi, is a [[breast cancer]] survivor.

==Politics==

==Philanthropy==
Agassi has participated in many charity organizations and founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people. Agassi was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. It has also been surmised that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation, which includes [[Lance Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackvoices.com/black_sports/columnists/roysjohnson/_a/sportsmanperson-of-the-year/20061002123009990001 Sportsman/Person of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andre Agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. His Boys &amp; Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world class junior tennis team. It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.

In 2001, Agassi opened up the [http://www.agassiprep.org Andre Agassi College Prepatory Academy] in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area. Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark County's only residential facility for abused and neglected children called Child Haven. In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the '''Agassi Center for Education'''. His foundation also provided &quot;$720,000 to assist in the building of the '''Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children'''. This facility opened in December 2001 and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases. It houses approximately 20 beds and gives children with special needs the special attention needed to make them feel comfortable in their new surroundings.&quot; {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In 2007, Agassi, [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Warrick Dunn]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Mia Hamm]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Andrea Jaeger]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] founded the charity  [http://www.athletesforhope.org/ '''Athletes for Hope'''], which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.

==Quotations==

* About [[Pete Sampras|Pete Sampras']] retirement: &quot;You grow up with a guy, you compete against him for so long, he's such a big part of your career, something that's pretty special, so you do have that sense of personal regret that he's not around any more. You miss having that around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportolysis.com/2006/08/27/agassi-the-heart-of-tennis Agassi: The heart of tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 2005 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]: &quot;I've been motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me. There still is plenty out there to get motivated by.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/andreagass371461.html Andre Agassi quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeating [[James Blake]] in a quarterfinal, Agassi said, &quot;First of all, let me say, 1:15 in the morning, for 20,000 people to still be here, I wasn't the winner, tennis was. That's awesome. I don't know if I've ever felt so good here before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/08/opinion/open.php Tennis: Agassi sends a reminder to the younger set]&lt;/ref&gt;
* When [[Mats Wilander]] was asked in 2005 to name the top five tennis players of all time, he placed Agassi, Pete Sampras, [[Roger Federer]] and [[Björn Borg]] in the top four (in no order) and tied [[John McEnroe]], [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Jimmy Connors]] for fifth place.  Concerning Agassi, Wilander said, &quot;He has some limitations, like he can't serve and volley, yet he has won all four Slams. He has a very high energy level, quite like Borg. He is on fifth gear from the very first point. There is some abnormality in his eyes, otherwise he wouldn't have had such a phenomenal return. He sees the ball like no one else and just guides it wherever he wants to. He's just played a Grand Slam final at 35, that tells me he wasted the first five years of his career, otherwise, he couldn't have lasted this long. No one has done more to tennis than Agassi and Borg.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050927/asp/sports/story_5289222.asp Federer perhaps most complete player: Mats Wilander - Former world No. 1 picks his top five of last three decades]&lt;/ref&gt;
